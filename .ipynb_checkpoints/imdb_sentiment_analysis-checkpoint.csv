"Disney's live-action Snow White is finally here, and after watching it, I can confidently say that the Magic Mirror needs a new prescription. This movie is less ""fairest of them all"" and more ""fairest at failing upwards."" If you ever wondered what it would look like if someone took the classic 1937 animated masterpiece, ran it through a corporate buzzword generator, and then tossed in some awkward CGI for good measure-congratulations, you've found your answer!

A Princess with a Personality (Kind Of?)

Rachel Zegler takes on the role of Snow White, though you'd be forgiven for thinking she was actually playing a medieval TED Talk speaker. Instead of the wide-eyed, kind-hearted princess we all knew, this Snow White is a Strong Independent Woman™-because saying ""I want to be a queen, not a bride"" apparently counts as character development these days. That's right, folks, forget charming dwarfs, woodland creatures, or actual chemistry with anyone; this Snow White has dreams, and she's here to remind you about them every five minutes.

But despite all that, her biggest challenge in the movie isn't even the Evil Queen-it's keeping the audience awake.

Gal Gadot: Evil Queen or Instagram Influencer?

Now, let's talk about Gal Gadot's Evil Queen. You'd think that playing a narcissistic, beauty-obsessed villain would be an easy fit for Hollywood, but somehow, even with all the pouting, dress-swishing, and over-the-top glowering, she ends up about as menacing as a fashion blogger with a bad attitude.

Her obsession with being ""the fairest of them all"" is laughable when you realize that, well... she already is the fairest of them all. No offense to Snow White, but if the mirror told me that Gal Gadot wasn't the hottest person in the kingdom, I'd be smashing that thing to pieces too. The real villain here is the mirror's manufacturer.

The Dwarfs: Now with 90% Less Dwarfs!

Ah yes, the seven dwarfs-except, surprise! They're not really dwarfs anymore. Instead, we get a diverse group of CGI-enhanced ""magical creatures"" who look like they were rejected from The Lord of the Rings for being too unsettling. Imagine if a bunch of carnival performers got stuck in a blender with bad CGI, and you've got these guys.

Their role in the movie? Mostly to exist, deliver unfunny one-liners, and make you wonder if we should start a petition to bring back actual actors instead of whatever motion-capture madness this is. If I wanted to spend two hours looking at weirdly animated characters, I'd just play a bad video game.

The Apple Fiasco

We all know the story: Evil Queen poisons apple, Snow White eats apple, Snow White falls into a death nap, and then a prince shows up to wake her with true love's kiss. Simple, right? Nope. Not in this version.

Instead, we get a long, drawn-out scene where Snow White almost eats the apple, but then stops to give another speech about believing in yourself or some nonsense. And when she does finally bite it, the whole moment is ruined by some weird slow-motion effects that make it look like an overly dramatic shampoo commercial.

Honestly, I was rooting for the apple at that point. Maybe if she stayed in an enchanted coma, we'd all be spared another unnecessary Disney remake.

Final Verdict: The Fairest Disaster of Them All

This movie is what happens when you take a beloved classic, strip away everything that made it charming, and replace it with corporate-approved ""modernization"" that pleases no one. It's a film that wants to be empowering, but instead feels like a checklist of forced inclusivity and soulless spectacle.

Snow White (2025) is proof that sometimes, it's better to leave well enough alone. If you're looking for magic, wonder, and nostalgia, just rewatch the 1937 version.

"As always, whenever there's a negative hype around a movie, my mindset is always, prove them wrong, give it a chance.

It's diabolical, honestly, I can't understand how so much money and so much time has gone into this, the final result is cringe worthy. It is an absolute shocker, I am stumped to find any positives.

It looks and feels so artificial, the sets, the animals, as for The Dwarves themselves, I have no words to express my feelings there.

The biggest catastrophe, not what I was expecting if I'm honest, the worst offender, Gal Gadot, she looks sensational, but her performance, she's going to scoop some unwanted awards it's fair to say.

"Disney's latest live-action remake, Snow White (2025), is yet another attempt to cash in on nostalgia, but unfortunately, it falls flat in almost every regard. From lackluster performances to subpar CGI, this film struggles to capture the magic of the original classic.

Rachel Zegler: A Miscast Lead

Rachel Zegler, who takes on the iconic role of Snow White, delivers a performance that feels stiff and uninspired. While she undeniably has a strong singing voice, her acting lacks the warmth and charm that made the animated Snow White so beloved. Her line delivery often comes off as forced, and she struggles to bring emotional depth to the character. Instead of exuding the innocence and kindness associated with Snow White, her portrayal feels distant and, at times, even disengaged.

Weak CGI and Bland Visuals

For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI is shockingly subpar. The enchanted forest, which should have felt lush and immersive, looks artificial, and the CGI creatures lack the expressiveness and charm of their animated counterparts. The dwarfs-who have been controversially reimagined-look awkward and unnatural, making it hard to emotionally invest in their presence. The visual effects in Snow White feel rushed, and instead of enhancing the experience, they serve as a constant distraction.

Music: Strong Vocals, Forgettable Songs

If there's one aspect where the film slightly shines, it's Zegler's singing. She undeniably has a beautiful voice, and her vocal performances are solid. However, the new songs she's given are bland and unmemorable, failing to capture the whimsy and timeless appeal of the original soundtrack. Unlike Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid, which at least had a few standout musical moments, Snow White's soundtrack feels generic and uninspired.

Conclusion: A Missed Opportunity

Ultimately, Snow White is another soulless live-action remake that lacks the heart and magic of the original. While Zegler's singing is a bright spot, her acting, coupled with bad CGI and uninspired musical numbers, makes this adaptation feel unnecessary. Disney had an opportunity to bring a fresh and captivating take on Snow White, but instead, they delivered a forgettable and lackluster film. Fans of the original will likely leave disappointed, longing for the charm and artistry that made the 1937 classic a masterpiece.",1/10,disney latest remake snow white yet another attempt cash nostalgia unfortunately falls flat almost every regard lackluster performances subpar cgi film struggles capture magic original classic rachel zegler miscast lead rachel zegler takes iconic role snow white delivers performance feels stiff uninspired undeniably strong singing voice acting lacks warmth charm made animated snow white beloved line delivery often comes forced struggles bring emotional depth character instead exuding innocence kindness associated snow white portrayal feels distant times even disengaged weak cgi bland visuals film disney budget cgi shockingly subpar enchanted forest felt lush immersive looks artificial cgi creatures lack expressiveness charm animated counterparts controversially awkward unnatural making hard emotionally invest presence visual effects snow white feel rushed instead enhancing experience serve constant distraction music strong vocals forgettable songs one aspect film slightly shines zegler singing undeniably beautiful voice vocal performances solid however new songs given bland unmemorable failing capture whimsy timeless appeal original soundtrack unlike beauty beast little mermaid least standout musical moments snow white soundtrack feels generic uninspired conclusion missed opportunity ultimately snow white another soulless remake lacks heart magic original zegler singing bright spot acting coupled bad cgi uninspired musical numbers makes adaptation feel unnecessary disney opportunity bring fresh captivating take snow white instead delivered forgettable lackluster film fans original likely leave disappointed longing charm artistry made classic masterpiece,0.9794,0.226,0.139,0.635
"Saw this at the cinema with my six-year-old daughter. She laughed at a few scenes but whispered, ""this is boring"" about forty five minutes in. Watched the rest but we were both happy when the movie ended.

For me, the CGI was distractingly bad. I wasn't aware of the issues the film had with casting prior to the release but they should have either gone with actual actors or spent more money. It's worse than you think, and it's not just the dwarves, the forest and other scenes are poorly done.

A couple of the songs were catchy but by that point I just wanted the credits to roll. Acting wise, I guess the actors had to work with what they were given, but they seemed disconnected and going through the motions. Snow white's lines sounded forced and uncommitted. A better actor might have played the role more believably but again, she had to work with what she was given. I think though, the original film had an innocence this actress didn't grasp or was unable to portray.

Really, this movie seemed more like a 'direct to video' movie than a large budget Disney production. I've seen better CGI in small budget television shows and far better acting. Maybe miss this one unless your little ones really want to see it. Even then, maybe wait for it to be free on a streaming service. It's just not worth paying to see.",1/10,saw cinema daughter laughed scenes whispered boring forty five minutes watched rest happy movie ended cgi distractingly bad aware issues film casting prior release either gone actual actors spent money worse think dwarves forest scenes poorly done couple songs catchy point wanted credits roll acting wise guess actors work given seemed disconnected going motions snow white lines sounded forced uncommitted better actor might played role believably work given think though original film innocence actress grasp unable portray really movie seemed like video movie large budget disney production seen better cgi small budget television shows far better acting maybe miss one unless little ones really want see even maybe wait free streaming service worth paying see,0.9623,0.253,0.107,0.64
"Snow White remake set out to modernize the classic fairy tale, but it ultimately leaves audiences disappointed. The film fails to stay true to the original story while also struggling to establish its own identity.

First and foremost, the lifeless script is a major issue. The characters lack depth, the dialogues feel artificial, and there's no emotional connection with the audience. Key elements of the fairy tale have been altered, but rather than making the story more engaging, these changes strip it of its essence.

The performances aren't particularly impressive either. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks charisma and inspiration, making the character feel ordinary and at times even unlikable. Additionally, the characters replacing the seven dwarfs are weakly designed and serve no meaningful purpose in the story.

When it comes to visuals and production quality, the film is shockingly mediocre for a Disney production. The CGI looks cheap, backgrounds feel artificial, and instead of creating a magical atmosphere, the movie ends up looking dull and uninspired.

Ultimately, this film feels like Disney turning its back on its own legacy. It doesn't come across as a loving modernization of a beloved classic but rather a project driven by political correctness with little artistic vision. The result? A failed adaptation that neither satisfies old fans nor captivates new audiences.

Another remake where Disney continues to kill the magic of its classic animations...",1/10,snow white remake set modernize classic fairy tale ultimately leaves audiences disappointed film fails stay true original story also struggling establish identity first foremost lifeless script major issue characters lack depth dialogues feel artificial emotional connection audience key elements fairy tale altered rather making story engaging changes strip essence performances particularly impressive either rachel zegler portrayal snow white lacks charisma inspiration making character feel ordinary times even unlikable additionally characters replacing seven dwarfs weakly designed serve meaningful purpose story comes visuals production quality film shockingly mediocre disney production cgi looks cheap backgrounds feel artificial instead creating magical atmosphere movie ends looking dull uninspired ultimately film feels like disney turning back legacy come across loving modernization beloved classic rather project driven political correctness little artistic vision result failed adaptation neither satisfies old fans captivates new audiences another remake disney continues kill magic classic animations,0.3575,0.176,0.157,0.666
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is yet another misguided attempt to modernize a classic, but instead of breathing new life into the beloved fairy tale, it strips away everything that made the original special. With uninspired performances, weak visuals, and forgettable music, this film serves as a prime example of why not every animated masterpiece needs a live-action remake.

Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm Casting Rachel Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her. Her line delivery feels forced, and there's little emotional connection between her and the world she's supposed to inhabit.

Dull Visuals & Poor CGI Disney is known for its stunning animation and groundbreaking CGI, but Snow White (2025) somehow manages to look cheap and unpolished. The enchanted forest, which should have been lush and magical, looks like an over-processed video game backdrop. The CGI dwarfs, which already sparked controversy before release, look awkward and unnatural, making it even harder to connect with them emotionally. Rather than immersing the audience in a fantasy world, the visuals constantly pull you out of the experience.

Music: A Forgettable Soundtrack The one highlight of the film is Zegler's singing, but even that can't save the uninspired and generic new songs. Unlike Disney's previous live-action adaptations, which at least attempted to reimagine classic melodies, Snow White (2025) fails to create any memorable musical moments. The new songs lack the magic of Someday My Prince Will Come or Heigh-Ho, leaving nothing that audiences will hum after leaving the theater.

Conclusion: Another Failed Remake Snow White (2025) is a textbook example of how not to remake a beloved film. Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away its charm and replaces it with a lifeless, forgettable adaptation. Disney had the chance to create something special, but what we got instead is yet another uninspired cash grab that fails to justify its existence. Fans of the original will likely leave the theater disappointed and frustrated, once again questioning why Disney insists on remaking its animated classics when the magic clearly isn't there.

"Putting aside of all the political controversy and discussions revolving around the film, if we focus this remake as itself, still, it is really unnecessary and quite dull.

Disney has continued to prove that live-action remakes of classic animated tales are getting tiresome and unoriginal. Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive. Snow White is one of those dull ones. Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial. Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here. The choice of using CGI dwarfs really was a bad idea because it came off as quite uncanny and unintentionally creepy to observe at times.

The performances....aren't very great. Rachel Zegler does give her best as she does have solid moments including some of the voice performances from the other cast. Gal Gadot, however, her performance really didn't work at all. Gadot lacks the emotion and creep charm to what the Evil Queen should have been.

Despite some good looking designs on the backgrounds and all, it was really boring. Marc Webb tries his best but unfortunately, really little about this would ever work.

"I honestly had no issue watching this movie. At first I skeptical with all drama from the actresses pre-release, but it wasn't bad at all. The musical was pretty good actually. Yes, Snow White's acting could be better, but it wasn't awful. I like that the love theme stayed in the movie and wasn't just about a strong woman leader. My biggest complaint is that they used CGI for the dwarves. I understand why though (to maintain their familiarity with the original) but using real dwarfs would of been better.

"To be fair, I have thought a lot of this movie and found the conclusion that Disney does neither understand the old animated movies nor the original fairy tales.

If you do a twisted fairy tale movie, okay all right, then use a different name, as was done with Frozen or Tangled or ""Mirror, Mirror"" and whatever. Of course, Disney movies are always different, but there is a high responsibility as they are regarded as cultural representation, and as a German, I really want to talk about this controversy. All right, if you need to change the back story of the name Snow White, why not simply introduce a real name. Dwarfs in fairy tales are of course not the same as people with dwarfism, and so the CGI idea with also introducing a human actor with dwarfism (with even a heroic task) could have worked, but removing simply the word dwarf does not help. How odd, as usually Disney is so careful of historical accuracy, there is silence about the obvious German connotations of both 1937 movie and the original tale. Although the love story with a guy called Jonathan is more contemporary elaborated than the insta-meet-cute with her prince, it can not evoke the same emotions as the 1937 movie. CGI animals are cute, but seriously? Snow was already in 1937 a leading lady and strong character, but Walt Disney decided to focus on a decision for love instead of power or ambition, so the political-moral connotations in this new movie are rather more backwarded than they actually are thinking. Although going the safe way with keeping definitely surprisingly many things intact from the 1937 movie, even with an old-fashioned fairy tale book opening and taking something from Cinderella live action - with amazing brightness and cheerfulness, it soon goes away from the old story into a world of reimagining. It makes me think of ""Mirror, Mirror"" with touch of the Disney Robin Hood and Tangled movies (and a bit of the German Simsala Grimm Schneewittchen version!), yet failing to showcase the kindness Snowy is constantly talking about. There could have made better use of the original tales (Brothers Grimm, but also tradition of Ludwig Bechstein, Johann Musäus and Ludwig Albert Grimm). Never much exploring the original characters, but somehow throwing in Jonathan's seven bandits as MIRRORED version to the dwarfs (these were the first version leaked, which turns out not to be the 7 ""dwarfs"",which is a good attempt to keep up a mirror structure of the main Disney couple), but so random named (Bingley?? Norwich??? Why???). Anyway, the music is charming, but reminds with ""let go, let glow"" too much of you know what I mean, also such like a reminiscence ""Waiting on a Miracle"" from Encanto. The spectacular musical scenes are very good, but a big contrast to the quiet cottage-core feeling of the 1937 movie In fact, it's a twisted remix, just like a rock/pop version of a music piece by Mozart. It might be worth as an idea offering enjoyable moments and tunes, but considering it as improvement is insane. Just like Enchanted was already a reimagining of Snow White, this is also another one and should be called in my opinion perhaps ""Mirrored"". An interesting advertisement campaign for the old movie and related products through reverse psychology. Particularly, too many mixed ideas. ""Strong independent"" - but princess -, still not as daring as in Mirror, Mirror, here in a child costume advertisement spot, and let's not forget that girl empowerment does not work this way with an anachronistic understanding of monarchy (Disney Queen franchise?), and let us simply dream, not be lessoned...",1/10,fair thought lot movie found conclusion disney neither understand old animated movies original fairy tales twisted fairy tale movie okay right use different name done frozen tangled mirror mirror whatever course disney movies always different high responsibility regarded cultural representation german really want talk controversy right need change back story name snow white simply introduce real name dwarfs fairy tales course people dwarfism cgi idea also introducing human actor dwarfism even heroic task could worked removing simply word dwarf help odd usually disney careful historical accuracy silence obvious german connotations movie original tale although love story guy called jonathan contemporary elaborated prince evoke emotions movie cgi animals cute seriously snow already leading lady strong character walt disney decided focus decision love instead power ambition connotations new movie rather backwarded actually thinking although going safe way keeping definitely surprisingly many things intact movie even fairy tale book opening taking something cinderella live action amazing brightness cheerfulness soon goes away old story world reimagining makes think mirror mirror touch disney robin hood tangled movies bit german simsala grimm schneewittchen version yet failing showcase kindness snowy constantly talking could made better use original tales brothers grimm also tradition ludwig bechstein johann musäus ludwig albert grimm never much exploring original characters somehow throwing jonathan seven bandits mirrored version dwarfs first version leaked turns dwarfs good attempt keep mirror structure main disney couple random named bingley norwich anyway music charming reminds let go let glow much know mean also like reminiscence waiting miracle encanto spectacular musical scenes good big contrast quiet feeling movie fact twisted remix like version music piece mozart might worth idea offering enjoyable moments tunes considering improvement insane like enchanted already reimagining snow white also another one called opinion perhaps mirrored interesting advertisement campaign old movie related products reverse psychology particularly many mixed ideas strong independent princess still daring mirror mirror child costume advertisement spot let forget girl empowerment work way anachronistic understanding monarchy disney queen franchise let us simply dream lessoned,0.9978,0.261,0.035,0.704
"The remake of Snow White is far from living up to its beloved origins. The film fails to capture the charm and magic of the original, and its modern reinterpretation leaves much to be desired. The acting performances are lackluster and unconvincing, with the cast struggling to truly inhabit their roles.

Similarly, the singing-a cornerstone of any classic Disney production-falls flat, delivering numbers that are both technically weak and emotionally uninspired.

This review is not about political correctness or the current trend of being ""woke."" Instead, it's about a missed opportunity to honor a timeless tale. Disney had the chance to recapture the nostalgic essence that made the original so cherished but instead opted for a misguided reinvention that erases much of the magic and wonder we once knew. The story, characters, and musical numbers suffer from a lack of creative vision, resulting in a product that is both disappointing and disheartening.

Ultimately, the Snow White remake is not worth the entry price, as it fails to evoke the emotional resonance and excitement that audiences expect from a Disney classic.

"I attended the Snow White remake last Thursday with high hopes, only to find myself marooned in a sea of kitsch, cheap effects, and an utterly barren vision.

Marc Webb's direction could generously be described as a masterclass in mediocrity-an exercise in how not to reimagine a classic. His handling of the material was so devoid of creativity that even the most outlandish camp would have been an improvement.

The so-called seven dwarfs? They weren't authentic actors at all; instead, we were treated to a parade of CGI caricatures that failed to capture any semblance of charm. Their forced musical numbers were as out-of-place as a kazoo in a symphony-an entirely misguided attempt at infusing musical flair that only underscored the film's overall discordance.

Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White was painfully bland, with a performance that vacillated between uninspired and downright wooden. And then there's Gal Gadot as the evil queen-her performance, marred by a haughty arrogance, was as unconvincing as it was theatrically misguided. The chemistry, or lack thereof, among the cast only amplified the film's deficiencies.

Every element-from the poor acting to the mismatched musical attempts-conspired to create an experience that was both artistically bankrupt and humorously tragic. It's astonishing how a project can simultaneously squander a beloved tale and insult the audience's intelligence.

Save your time, money, and sanity; this film is a stark reminder that not every retelling deserves a second chance.

"Snow White, the original animated film, was incredibly popular and was responsible for a much needed morale boost during a dark time in the US and the globe.

The remake is not a credit to the original, in many ways it makes a mockery of the original, taking the beloved character and shifting her entirely into someone else.

The music was halfhearted and the dwarves felt like an afterthought, the plot doesn't really involve them beyond their presence, you can tell that many retakes occurred and that fact should be invisible to the audience.

"If you ever wondered how a timeless fairy tale could be transmogrified into a cinematic trainwreck, ""Snow White (2025)"" answers that question in the most excruciatingly painful way possible. This live-action disaster-directed by Marc Webb-manages to twist a magical classic into a hollow parody that insults its own source material.

From the first frame to the final cringe-worthy scene, nothing about this film feels authentic or magical. Rachel Zegler's Snow White, instead of exuding grace or wonder, stumbles through a muddled script that seems more intent on pandering to modern gimmicks than honoring a beloved tale. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, though a familiar face, appears trapped in an identity crisis that renders her both over-the-top and underwhelming. The production's relentless overuse of flashy effects and forced modern sensibilities transforms what should have been a timeless narrative into a disjointed mess-an exercise in creative misdirection that leaves audiences wondering if the director was aiming for satire or if he was simply out of ideas.

The film doesn't just miss the mark-it shatters it into a million unwatchable pieces.

"Thoroughly enjoyed. Went in skeptical and prepared to dislike this modern live-action retelling of Disney's Snow White. Casting was fine and well acted. I enjoyed Pasek & Paul's new songs...think mixture of Greatest Showman with Disney sound. Ziegler's voice is a highlight. I thought the seven dwarfs were hilarious and great; very cgi but it worked. A great mix of modern and nostalgia. If I want to see the original, I'll just watch the original. What didn't work for me was costuming/look of Jonathan (new character love interest for Snow White, just a bit too grungy bohemian of a look), and the Evil Queen's song was too whimsical.

Unfortunately, the only thing this live action remake looks set to beat is the very low IMDB rating of the 2022 Pinocchio live action remake which has a rating of just 5/10, even with the star power of Tom Hanks, Snow White is sitting at 2 at the moment.

"A Catastrophe of Epic Proportions - A Career-Low for Everyone Involved

Where do I even begin? This movie is not just bad-it's a cinematic trainwreck that should be studied in film schools as a cautionary tale. Every aspect of this film, from the acting to the script to the direction, feels like a masterclass in how not to make a movie.

Let's start with Gal Gadot. Her line delivery is wooden, her expressions range from mildly confused to completely indifferent, and any attempt at emotion falls flat.

The script is an absolute disaster-full of nonsensical dialogue, forced exposition, and laughable attempts at drama. It's as if the writers Googled how to write a screenplay and then actively ignored every good piece of advice. The pacing is absolutely torturous. Scenes drag on for what feels like hours, yet nothing of importance happens. It's both boring and exhausting, which is a rare and unfortunate combination.

And then there's the direction. The action, if you can call it that, is a jittery mess, with rapid cuts that make even the simplest sequences unwatchable. The cinematography is uninspired, and the tone is all over the place-at times trying to be serious, then suddenly switching to unintentional comedy.

The final nail in the coffin is the sheer lack of originality. Every trope, every cliché, every overused plot device is thrown into the mix with no attempt at innovation. It's as if this movie was made by an AI trained exclusively on the worst action scripts ever written.

Simply put, this film is an insult to audiences. It's not just a bad movie-it's an unwatchable disaster. Save your time, your money, and your sanity. Avoid at all costs.

"Disney's live-action Snow White aims to reimagine a timeless fairy tale, yet it falters dramatically due to Gal Gadot's uninspired portrayal of the Evil Queen. Gadot's performance is marked by an overdone, mechanical display of villainy-her exaggerated eyebrow arch and flat vocal delivery fail to capture any real menace or seductive complexity. One respected critic from DiscussingFilm even claimed this might be Gadot's worst performance to date. Rather than delivering a multifaceted, memorable antagonist, Gadot's Queen comes off as a poorly conceived caricature that drains the film of dramatic tension.

"The 2025 remake of Snow White is, quite frankly, a disaster in every sense. What was once a timeless fairy tale full of heart and wonder has been stripped down to a dull, lifeless spectacle with none of the charm or magic that made the original so beloved.

The acting is flat and uninspired, with performances that feel forced and emotionally disconnected. The lead actress, in particular, struggles to bring any real presence or depth to the iconic role of Snow White, leaving the character feeling hollow and unrelatable.

Visually, the film fares no better. The animation and effects are shockingly subpar - at times reminiscent of outdated video game graphics. Rather than enchanting the audience, the film bombards them with artificial visuals that lack any real artistic vision.

But perhaps the greatest failure lies in the story itself. The narrative is scattered, lifeless, and entirely devoid of emotional resonance. Gone is the heart of the original tale, replaced by a rushed, soulless plot that seems more interested in ticking boxes than telling a meaningful story.

They tried really hard to make it modern and ""different,"" but in doing that, they stripped away everything that made the original story charming and magical. It felt more like they were pushing a message than telling a fairy tale. Not saying stories can't evolve, but this one felt forced.

Rachel Zegler's version of Snow White wasn't relatable or likeable. She came off a bit self-important instead of kind and warm like the Snow White we all know. And where are the dwarfs? They swapped them out for random magical creatures, and it just didn't have the same fun vibe. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen was probably the best part-she had some great moments-but even she couldn't save it.

"Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a cinematic catastrophe that fails on every level. This soulless, cringeworthy abomination is a travesty that insults the very concept of storytelling. With a 1/10 rating from critics and audiences alike, it's clear that this movie is a complete and utter disaster.

The first issue is the script, which is a jumbled mess of clichés and poorly written dialogue. The characters are paper-thin, with Snow White herself being a blank slate with no discernible personality. The Seven Dwarfs are reduced to mere caricatures, with no depth or development. The villain, the Evil Queen, is a one-dimensional caricature with no motivation or backstory.

The acting is equally atrocious, with Rachel Zegler struggling to convey any sense of emotion or charisma. Her Snow White is a wooden, unengaging presence on screen, with all the charm and warmth of a damp sock. The supporting cast fares no better, with the usually reliable Gal Gadot and Ben Kingsley phoning in their performances.

The direction is equally uninspired, with Chris Buck and Marc Webb failing to bring any sense of wonder or magic to the proceedings. The action scenes are dull and uninspired, with the special effects looking like they were ripped straight from a video game. The music is forgettable and unmemorable, with none of the iconic songs from the original Disney classic making an appearance.

But perhaps the biggest problem with Snow White is its complete lack of originality. The story is a lazy retread of the original fairy tale, with no new twists or surprises to speak of. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, with the jokes feeling forced and unnatural.

Took my two daughters to see this. Went in with an open mind. It was sadly absolutely dreadful. The lead actress has no charisma. The script is poor. It's repetitive. All gloss and no substance.

"It's honestly quite eye-rolling how people have ganged up on this movie. It's clear they have nothing better to do than to try to bring people down. I'd hate to live my life like that. Especially considering this movie turns out to be one of the most innocent features to come out in a while.

I went into Snow White without any devoted dedication to the original. For the first ever full-length animated feature, it has some good expressions, refreshingly organic animation, good colours and decent slapstick. It's also kind of slow-paced in my opinion, and I find it more enchanting as a piece of history than something I'll want to revisit. This movie on the other hand...

I knew they were trying a few new things with this one, and I was more interested in what those would be than honouring the original. And I have to say this new but still familiar take on the classic story was a feast on the eyes and especially the ears.

This is more of a Frozen-style musical, which is a hit-or-miss genre for me, but turns out, the songs, especially the new songs, are delightful. There are a few times where I felt they could've shaved off one or two, or not paused before the end. But every song was toe-tapping, and got better the more they went along. My favourites had to be Waiting on a Wish, Good Things Grow, and Hand Meets A Hand. I'm generally not a fan of musicals with too much music, because sometimes I feel there are moments that are better spoken than sung. This is no exception. But every moment where I felt that, I have to admit, the song was still decent. They don't get rid of the songs from the original, but the completely new songs were my favourites.

The dwarfs were a bit off-putting at first, but that's primarily because I'm so used to seeing them in cartoon form after all these years, whether from the original movie or in promos. But the truth is, if they were more similar to their original designs, they probably would've seemed plastic. And as the movie went on, I got used to them. Dopey took a fair minute, but I grew to like each of their designs.

And Rachel Zegler is incredible. I became a fan of hers after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and I knew from that film she was going to be an amazing Snow White and she did not disappoint. Her singing, her soul, her completely natural and sincere performance...she's always been an amazing actress, and since this is her most popular project yet, I hope people really see it for what it is and give her the praise she deserves.

Snow White's two main messages are simple; united we stand, divided we fall. And rulers who hoard wealth and create division are evil. Oh, and that a bit of kindness goes a long way. Sometimes it's very on-the-nose. And it could've gone further in those messages. But in the end...those things are there, and they are the truth. What this movie is is a simple display of these messages, but in a world where we're encouraged to hate one another so much, it's nice to see a movie proud to promote inclusivity and togetherness, and how those values make you a true leader for the people. Kids will enjoy the messages, but adults may be reminded of how these things they were probably taught when they were kids...maybe they need a reminder of them? Like To Kill A Mockingbird, the movie reminds us that sometimes adults forget themselves and lose their innocence. And maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing to try and reclaim it.

This live-action remake honours the original that started animation as we know it, and extends the world with a more involving story, some new terrific songs, and a superb lead actress carrying it all. It's not perfect but it's honourable. Like the 2007 Hairspray, I finished the movie with my feet tapping. I'm looking forward to watching it again.

"Disney's live-action Snow White is a perfect example of how not to handle a classic fairytale. The biggest crimes this adaptation commits is its absolute disregard for the original story. Gone is the whimsical fairytale magic, replaced with a forced, uninspired attempt at modernizing something that was never broken.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a complete departure from the classic character. She lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the original, instead coming across as smug and self-righteous For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI and cinematography are shockingly bland. The movie is visually sterile, lacking the rich, hand crafted beauty of the original animation.

"Disney's 2025 Snow White isn't just a misstep-it's a full-blown tumble down a creative cliff. In a clumsy attempt to ""modernize"" the classic, the film strips away the magic, charm, and heart that made the original a timeless masterpiece.

Rachel Zegler's performance, while technically competent, feels emotionally disconnected. Her Snow White comes off less like a dreamer and more like someone begrudgingly enduring a role she doesn't believe in. It's hard to root for a character who seems to roll her eyes at the very story she's part of.

The dwarfs-sorry, the ""mystical forest dwellers""-are barely distinguishable, both in personality and purpose. What was once a band of lovable, quirky companions is now a generic group of background extras with less chemistry than a high school science lab.

And then there's the writing. Bland, preachy, and painfully self-aware, the script is so focused on making statements that it forgets to tell a story. The dialogue feels like it was churned out by a committee more interested in Twitter applause than timeless storytelling.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. Sure, there are some beautiful shots, but they're buried under flat CGI environments that feel more like a theme park ride than an enchanted forest.

Ultimately, this Snow White is less a reimagining and more a joyless rebranding. In its eagerness to prove it's not ""that old fairy tale,"" it forgets to be a fairy tale at all.

To all the bots who thought this was a ""wonderful"" movie, nice try.

"Snow White is not a bad movie. It is hardly a masterpiece either. The movie, although beautifully made, lacks the gentle beauty of the classic 1937 animation. The good intentions in making this movie and the goal to modernize it for younger audiences can be well seen, but was it really necessary?

From a song in which Snow White actually gives consent to the ""prince"" character prior to her eating the poison apple, to poor character development, inclusion of pointless characters and toning down of the Evil Queen's scary and devilish looming presence, the movie seems to be a patchwork quilt of some politically correct behavior, a not very deep story (although it tries to be), characters we know and love and some new ones we're introduced to and don't really get to know (and never do).

Rachel Zeggler both acts and sings beautifully and her theme song is a show stopper. Her vocals I dare say are clearer than Halle's Part of Your World. Now, Gal Gadot (oh boy) plays a flowy and way too over the top Evil Queen, that unfortunately is but a far dying echo of the Evil Queen in the animation.

Production problems and reshoots can be clearly seen when Snow White's hair distractingly changes both length and style, sometimes in the very same music sequence.

Speaking of music sequence, the Evil Queen absolutely did not need songs of her own, what breaks her character and makes us lose credibility in her evilness. She just feels...goofy.

I personally also felt a slight little political theme here and there, but that might just be me.

That being said, again the movie is not bad. It's CUTE and endearing but a little stale, like a cookie that's not very well baked, but it still ok. The visuals and CGI are stunning and, yes, I can see some uncanny valley happening with the dwarfes but nothing distracting or creepy at all. They look amazing nonetheless and the details are jaw dropping (Dopey was actually my favorite character in the movie).

"As someone who appreciates both classic Disney films and fresh reimaginings, I went into Snow White (2025) with an open mind. Unfortunately, what I got was a bland, uninspired adaptation that lacks the charm, heart, and magic of the original.

The biggest issue is the writing. The film strips away the fairy-tale wonder and replaces it with generic, uninspired storytelling. The dialogue feels forced, the emotional beats fall flat, and the pacing drags. Instead of enhancing the story, the changes to the original plot feel unnecessary, as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to make a statement rather than tell a good story.

The casting is another letdown. While there was potential, the performances feel wooden and lack chemistry. Snow White, a character who should embody kindness and wonder, comes across as oddly lifeless, and the supporting cast doesn't fare much better. The reimagined seven companions, in particular, feel out of place and lack the personality that made the dwarfs so memorable.

Visually, the movie has moments of beauty, but it's inconsistent. Some CGI-heavy sequences look rushed and artificial, breaking the immersion. The costume and set design, while ambitious, don't always fit the tone of the story, making it feel more like a generic fantasy film than a distinct Snow White adaptation.

Perhaps most disappointing is the lack of a strong musical presence. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is beloved in large part due to its iconic songs, but the new film's soundtrack is forgettable. Any attempts to modernize the music fall flat, making it feel soulless rather than enchanting.

Overall, Snow White (2025) is a missed opportunity. It fails to capture the magic of the classic while offering nothing compelling in return. Instead of a fresh and exciting reimagining, we're left with a hollow, uninspired film that will likely be forgotten soon after the credits roll.

"I don't even know where to begin with this utter disaster. From the first frame to the last, this movie is an insult to anyone who values cinema. The plot is a nonsensical jumble of ideas that not only fail to make sense but also seem completely random. It's as if the writers threw every trope into a blender, hoping that something would stick. Spoiler: Nothing does.

The acting was atrocious-if you can even call it that. The lead actor looked like they'd rather be anywhere else, delivering every line with the energy of a wet cardboard box. It was like watching someone who had no interest in the role try to read a script they barely understood. The supporting cast? Even worse. Their performances were so bad I was genuinely embarrassed for them. If this was a high school drama club production, I'd still be appalled.

The dialogue is so cringe-worthy that I almost wanted to walk out of the theater. The characters spoke like they were reading off a sheet of paper, with no chemistry or emotion between them. Any attempt at humor fell completely flat, and every ""dramatic"" moment was laughably contrived. It was as if the filmmakers thought slapping together some words would somehow create a compelling story.

Visually, it's a nightmare. The special effects are so poorly done that they look like they came from a low-budget student film. The cinematography was as uninspired as it gets-every shot felt lazy, like they were in a rush to get it over with. Not a single scene felt well thought out or purposeful. And the soundtrack? Forgettable, uninspired, and completely out of place.

The pacing was a torture. This film was way too long for the amount of nothing it offered. Scenes dragged on endlessly, and I found myself begging for it to end. By the time the credits finally rolled, I felt like I had just wasted hours of my life.

This movie is a crime against cinema. It's not just bad-it's a miserable, painful experience that will leave you regretting every second you spent watching it.

"The new Snow White movie is a glaring example of how reboots can miss the mark when trying too hard to modernize a classic story. While the film attempts to update the themes and characters for a contemporary audience, it ultimately sacrifices the heart and magic that made the original so beloved.

One of the most glaring issues is the weak writing. The dialogue often feels forced, with characters delivering lines that seem more focused on making a statement than advancing the story naturally. The plot itself is a far cry from the whimsical charm of the original, coming across as overly complicated yet emotionally hollow.

The casting decisions, while bold, fail to deliver. The lead performance lacks the charisma and warmth required to carry the film, making it difficult to connect with the character. Even the supporting cast struggles to shine, with underwhelming portrayals of iconic roles that feel uninspired and forgettable.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some scenes boast impressive production design, others are marred by unconvincing CGI that detracts from the overall experience. The cinematography fails to capture the enchanting, storybook-like quality one would expect from a Snow White adaptation.

Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is the lack of emotional resonance. Where the original thrived on themes of love, kindness, and courage, this version feels more like a lifeless attempt to tick off boxes of modern trends rather than a heartfelt retelling.

Overall, the new Snow White feels like a shallow, uninspired attempt to cash in on nostalgia while alienating fans of the original. Instead of capturing the timeless magic of the story, it leaves you longing for the charm and simplicity of the 1937 classic.",1/10,new snow white movie glaring example reboots miss mark trying hard modernize classic story film attempts update themes characters contemporary audience ultimately sacrifices heart magic made original beloved one glaring issues weak writing dialogue often feels forced characters delivering lines seem focused making statement advancing story naturally plot far cry whimsical charm original coming across overly complicated yet emotionally hollow casting decisions bold fail deliver lead performance lacks charisma warmth required carry film making difficult connect character even supporting cast struggles shine underwhelming portrayals iconic roles feel uninspired forgettable visually film mixed bag scenes boast impressive production design others marred unconvincing cgi detracts overall experience cinematography fails capture enchanting quality one would expect snow white adaptation perhaps disappointing aspect lack emotional resonance original thrived themes love kindness courage version feels like lifeless attempt tick boxes modern trends rather heartfelt retelling overall new snow white feels like shallow uninspired attempt cash nostalgia alienating fans original instead capturing timeless magic story leaves longing charm simplicity classic,0.9726,0.25,0.138,0.611
"Disney's live-action Snow White is not just bad-it's an insult to the original classic. From the moment the film starts, it becomes painfully clear that this remake has no heart, no soul, and no reason to exist beyond squeezing money out of nostalgia.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is one of the biggest disappointments. Rather than exuding menace or charm, she delivers a bland, lifeless performance that feels more like a last-minute casting decision than a carefully chosen role. Her lack of depth makes the Queen more laughable than intimidating, turning an iconic villain into a forgettable mess.

The worst part? The film's attempt to ""modernize"" the story comes off as painfully forced and preachy. Instead of adding depth, it strips away the whimsy and wonder that made Snow White a beloved fairytale in the first place. The story drags through dull, uninspired dialogue, and any attempt at emotional weight feels hollow.

Visually, the film is another disaster. The excessive CGI looks cheap and artificial, making everything feel more like a second-rate video game than a big-budget Disney production. Instead of immersing the audience in a magical world, it actively pulls them out of the experience with lifeless backdrops and characters that feel oddly disconnected from their surroundings.

"Let's just cut to the chase-this movie is trash. I don't know what Disney was thinking, but this remake is an insult to the classic Snow White and honestly, to anyone who values good storytelling, acting, or just basic entertainment.

First off, Rachel Zegler as Snow White? Huge mistake. Her performance feels forced, awkward, and honestly, it seems like she doesn't even want to be there. There's no charm, no warmth-just an overwhelming sense that she's reading off a script and waiting for the check to clear. And Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? Yeah, she looks great, but her performance is so over-the-top it's almost cartoonish. She's not menacing-she's just cringe.

And let's talk about the visuals-Disney had a massive budget, and somehow, this movie still looks like it was shot on a green screen with the cheapest CGI imaginable. The dwarfs? Oh wait-there are no dwarfs. Instead, we get a bunch of random, forgettable side characters that add nothing to the story. It's like Disney went out of their way to make sure nothing about this film resembles what people actually liked about Snow White.

The music? Completely unmemorable. You won't be humming any of these new songs because they sound like they were written by AI on a bad day. Meanwhile, they stripped away the iconic songs from the original because, I don't know, Disney just hates joy now?

And let's not forget the story-it's a mess. They tried to ""modernize"" the plot by making Snow White some kind of girlboss warrior princess who doesn't need a prince, but it's so forced and hollow that it just makes the movie boring. It's not empowering, it's just bad writing.

Overall, this movie is a soulless cash grab that no one asked for. It's not fun, it's not magical, and it certainly doesn't justify its existence. Disney needs to stop with these live-action remakes and actually focus on making new, original films instead of ruining their classics.

"Disney's latest attempt to reimagine a beloved classic, Snow White (2025), is nothing short of a catastrophe. Stripping away the heart and soul that made the original a timeless masterpiece, this misguided remake fails to add anything meaningful to the legacy of Walt Disney's work. One can only imagine Walt Disney rolling in his grave at the sight of this soulless adaptation.

Rachel Zegler, portraying Snow White, delivers a performance that lacks warmth and charm-traits that are quintessential to the character. Her portrayal feels distant, disinterested, and forced, with her line delivery devoid of genuine emotion. As a result, the emotional connection between the audience and the protagonist is completely absent, making it hard to root for or even care about Snow White's journey.

The visuals, however, are the sole bright spot in this otherwise dismal production. The efforts of the VFX and CGI teams shine through, demonstrating remarkable skill and attention to detail. It's evident that this aspect of the film received genuine care and hard work from the VFX team, but unfortunately, it cannot carry the weight of an uninspired story and lackluster performances. I do think it would have been better if humans played the dwarves though, since there's a lot of them wanting work in Hollywood.

The soundtrack is equally disappointing, with new songs that fail to capture even a shred of the magic and memorable melodies of the original. Bland, forgettable, and uninspired, the music feels more like a filler than a vital component of the storytelling experience.

One of the most glaring flaws in Snow White (2025) lies in its complete disregard for the original story that made the classic an enduring piece of cinematic history. The charm and simplicity of the original fairy tale have been traded for a heavy-handed attempt to modernize the narrative, resulting in a story that feels disconnected and devoid of the timeless magic that Walt Disney so carefully crafted. What made Snow White a beloved tale for generations was its sincerity, innocence, and universal themes, all of which seem to have been discarded in favor of a hollow, surface-level reinterpretation.

Rather than paying homage to the original characters and their arcs, the new story feels like an attempt to reinvent them in ways that are jarring and unfaithful to the source material. This shift not only alienates fans of the original but also undermines the very essence of what made Snow White's journey resonate so deeply. It's as if the creators prioritized ticking boxes for modern trends over respecting the rich legacy of the original fairy tale.

The performances exacerbate the issue further, as it seems the actors themselves lack respect or understanding for the characters they are portraying. Snow White, a character known for her warmth, kindness, and unwavering optimism, is portrayed with a level of detachment that feels entirely out of place in a fairytale setting. The attempt to inject a new personality into the character comes across as disingenuous, further driving a wedge between the audience and the story.

In many moments, it feels as if the actors are trying to reshape their characters into something unrecognizable, rather than embracing the spirit of the roles they were entrusted with. This disconnect contributes to a sense that the cast and creators view the original material not as a treasured classic to build upon, but as an outdated relic to be replaced. The result is a story and set of performances that fail to capture the heart and whimsy of the fairy tale world.

By disregarding the foundational elements of Snow White, the 2025 remake betrays its source material and its audience. What should have been a celebration of one of Walt Disney's most iconic creations instead feels like a disjointed, half-hearted experiment that strips the tale of its soul. Fans who cherished the original for its timeless simplicity and heartfelt storytelling will find themselves deeply disappointed by this hollow rendition.

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) feels like a cash grab-a lifeless, unnecessary remake that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessor. Fans of the original will undoubtedly find themselves disappointed and questioning Disney's continued reliance on rehashing classic works. If Walt Disney were here to see this, he would undoubtedly be embarrassed by the state of his cherished studio.

"I went into the new Snow White movie hoping for a fresh, modern take on the beloved classic. What I got instead was a lifeless, uninspired mess that completely misses the charm and magic of the original.

First off, the writing is abysmal. The dialogue feels forced, the attempts at humor fall flat, and the changes to the story feel more like an agenda-pushing checklist than an organic adaptation. Snow White herself is completely devoid of personality, and rather than being a kind and courageous heroine, she comes across as smug and unlikable. The Evil Queen, who should be a scene-stealing villain, is reduced to a generic, one-dimensional antagonist.

The visuals don't help either. Despite a massive budget, the CGI looks cheap, the cinematography is dull, and the costumes are uninspired. Even the dwarves-if you can call them that-are completely forgettable. Whatever sense of wonder and whimsy Disney once had is long gone here.

But perhaps the worst part is how soulless the whole thing feels. Rather than honoring the timeless story that has captivated audiences for generations, this version seems embarrassed by its own source material. The filmmakers clearly wanted to ""fix"" Snow White, but in doing so, they drained it of everything that made it special.

Disney has been churning out unnecessary live-action remakes for years, but this one might be the most disappointing yet.

"Disney's 2025 Snow White remake attempts a modernized take on the beloved classic but ultimately struggles with execution. Rachel Zegler delivers a good performance, bringing some charm and depth to the character, yet the overall story feels disjointed and lacks the emotional weight of the original. The decision to use CGI dwarfs instead of practical effects or real actors is disappointing, as it removes much of the warmth and personality that made them so memorable. Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen fails to capture the menace and intensity of the original character, with her performance feeling somewhat flat and lacking the gravitas needed to make her a truly compelling villain. While the film is visually stunning, featuring beautiful set designs and vibrant cinematography, its uneven pacing and underwhelming narrative prevent it from making a lasting impact. These issues are reflected in its poor box office performance, grossing only $100 million against a staggering $350 million budget. A more cohesive balance between nostalgia and innovation, along with a stronger script and character development, could have made for a much more compelling adaptation.",1/10,disney snow white remake attempts modernized take beloved classic ultimately struggles execution rachel zegler delivers good performance bringing charm depth character yet overall story feels disjointed lacks emotional weight original decision use cgi dwarfs instead practical effects real actors disappointing removes much warmth personality made memorable gal gadot portrayal evil queen fails capture menace intensity original character performance feeling somewhat flat lacking gravitas needed make truly compelling villain film visually stunning featuring beautiful set designs vibrant cinematography uneven pacing underwhelming narrative prevent making lasting impact issues reflected poor box office performance grossing million staggering million budget cohesive balance nostalgia innovation along stronger script character development could made much compelling adaptation,0.9022,0.278,0.173,0.549

Every line sounds like she's two seconds away from unionizing the forest creatures. Meanwhile, Prince Charming shows up looking confused, like he wandered in from a different movie... and honestly?

"I even fell asleep and my 7 year ikd went all the movie saying... SO FAKE, Why is the Snow white angry? (just her face erupting his wokness bitter), why is the witch queen jealouse? She's prettier. Don't waste your money.

Disney's latest live-action Snow White is a complete disaster, failing on nearly every level. From its uninspired lead actress to its soulless CGI, the film is a far cry from the timeless charm of the original. Worse still, its rewritten dialogues strip away the warmth and values that made the classic story beloved, replacing them with a hollow, antisocial message that alienates its audience.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is one of the film's biggest weaknesses. She lacks the grace, innocence, and charm that made the original character so endearing. Instead of portraying a kind and humble princess, her version feels smug and detached, making it impossible to root for her. Her line delivery is often flat or overly self-assured, further distancing her from audiences expecting a sincere, heartfelt performance.

Visually, the film is just as unconvincing. The CGI-heavy effects strip the movie of any sense of realism or magic. The so-called ""dwarfs"" look like a lazy, computer-generated afterthought, draining the film of any personality. The artificial landscapes and overprocessed lighting make every scene feel plastic and soulless, turning what should be a visually rich fairytale into something that resembles a cheap video game cutscene.

Perhaps the most frustrating part is the film's complete disregard for the themes that made Snow White a beloved story in the first place. The rewritten dialogues turn what was once a tale of kindness, resilience, and family into an awkward, disjointed narrative that pushes an individualistic and almost antagonistic attitude toward traditional values. The result is a film that doesn't just fail to connect with the audience-it actively pushes them away.

In the end, Snow White is nothing more than a misguided, joyless attempt at modernizing a classic.

"Where do I even begin with the disaster that is the new Snow White movie? Watching it felt less like enjoying a cinematic fairytale and more like enduring a painfully long lecture on how not to adapt a classic. This remake somehow manages to strip away everything that made the original magical and replaces it with a hollow, tone-deaf mess filled with arrogance and incompetence.

Let's talk about the cast - or rather, the lack of any meaningful performances. The lead is woefully miscast, coming across as smug and detached from the character she's supposed to embody. There's an off-putting air of superiority that clashes with the humility and warmth you'd expect from Snow White. Instead of charm and sincerity, we get wooden line delivery and expressions that range from disinterest to condescension. The supporting cast isn't much better, with performances that feel like rushed table reads rather than crafted characters. It's as if the film was more focused on checking boxes than telling a story.

Visually, the film tries hard to be edgy and ""modern,"" but it ends up looking like a low-effort cosplay production. The special effects are inconsistent, and the costume design swings wildly between uninspired and downright bizarre. The original story's timeless themes of kindness, courage, and love are replaced with forced messaging that feels less empowering and more preachy.

In the end, this Snow White is an unfortunate example of how studios can butcher a beloved tale by losing sight of what made it resonate in the first place.

"I genuinely don't know where to begin with this film. Maybe by saying this: it's a tragedy. Not the good Shakespearean kind either-just a full-on disaster. As someone who grew up loving the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, I walked into this remake hoping for even a spark of that old Disney magic. Instead, I walked out confused, disappointed, and a little bit angry. This movie is the exact opposite of what Snow White is supposed to be.

Let's talk about the casting, because I think it's the core of the problem. Snow White is supposed to be this radiant, kind, innocent girl who lights up the forest with her goodness and charm. The actress in this version? Not even close. I'm not trying to be mean, but she had none of the softness or warmth you expect from Snow White. Her performance felt stiff, robotic even, and honestly... she seemed more annoyed than enchanted by anything around her. Where's the wonder? Where's the sweetness? There was nothing graceful or inspiring about her, and that's heartbreaking because Snow White is supposed to inspire.

And don't even get me started on the seven dwarfs. Or should I say... the ""weird background group of people who kind of live in the woods and are just there."" They completely stripped the dwarfs of their individual personalities. In the original, each dwarf was unique-Grumpy was grumpy, Dopey was adorable, Doc was wise. That's what made them memorable. But in this remake, they're like an awkward side quest no one wants to click on. They felt like they were just thrown into the movie out of obligation.

Visually? Meh. The colors were muted, the forest didn't look magical-it looked like someone tried to film Lord of the Rings on a budget in their backyard. There was no enchantment. The original had charm dripping out of every frame-those little forest animals helping Snow White, the cozy little cottage, the sparkle of the wishing well. This version tried to be ""modern"" and ""gritty"" or whatever, but in the process, it lost its soul.

And then there's the writing. It felt like someone who didn't even like fairy tales wrote this script. Snow White didn't grow as a character-she just existed, said a few snarky lines, and that was it. There was no heart. No real lesson. And honestly, no real love either. The Prince (if you can even call him that) was barely in the film and felt like an afterthought. The romantic element, which in the original added such emotional depth, was completely gone. I get that times have changed and stories evolve, but changing everything doesn't make it better. Especially when you replace charm with attitude and wonder with bland empowerment slogans.

Disney had the perfect opportunity here. They could have remastered the 1937 version, added a few visual tweaks, maybe even extended a few scenes. That would've been worth watching. That would've made people cry with nostalgia. Instead, they delivered a half-baked modern mess that disrespects its own legacy.",1/10,genuinely know begin film maybe saying tragedy good shakespearean kind disaster someone grew loving original snow white seven dwarfs walked remake hoping even spark old disney magic instead walked confused disappointed little bit angry movie exact opposite snow white supposed let talk casting think core problem snow white supposed radiant kind innocent girl lights forest goodness charm actress version even close trying mean none softness warmth expect snow white performance felt stiff robotic even honestly seemed annoyed enchanted anything around wonder sweetness nothing graceful inspiring heartbreaking snow white supposed inspire even get started seven dwarfs say weird background group people kind live woods completely stripped dwarfs individual personalities original dwarf grumpy dopey adorable doc wise made memorable remake like awkward side quest one wants click felt like thrown movie obligation visually meh colors muted forest look looked like someone tried film lord rings budget backyard enchantment original charm dripping every little forest animals helping snow white cozy little cottage sparkle wishing well version tried modern gritty whatever process lost soul writing felt like someone even like fairy tales wrote script snow white grow existed said snarky lines heart real lesson honestly real love either prince even call barely film felt like afterthought romantic element original added emotional depth completely gone get times changed stories evolve changing everything make better especially replace charm attitude wonder bland empowerment slogans disney perfect opportunity could remastered version added visual tweaks maybe even extended scenes would worth watching would made people cry nostalgia instead delivered modern mess disrespects legacy,0.9966,0.325,0.119,0.556

Rachel Zegler as Snow White? She's more annoying than lovable, and don't get me started on those creepy CGI dwarves that looked like they belonged in a video game, not a fairy tale.

The whole thing was way too flashy, with these bright colors and effects that just screamed ""look at me!"" instead of telling a good story. The songs went on forever and weren't even catchy-I was bored out of my mind waiting for it to wrap up. By the end, it felt like they just slapped some sparkle on it to make a quick buck, and I'm kinda mad I wasted my time on it.",,okay watched snow white movie honestly letdown story felt tried shove trendy updates fit vibe original left scratching head half time rachel zegler snow white annoying lovable get started creepy cgi dwarves looked like belonged video game fairy tale whole thing way flashy bright colors effects screamed look instead telling good story songs went forever even bored mind waiting wrap end felt like slapped sparkle make quick buck kinda mad wasted time,0.9242,0.281,0.133,0.586
"My wife and I caught Snow White (2025) in theaters this evening. The story follows a princess whose mother dies and whose father remarries. When he leaves for war, her stepmother reveals her true, diabolical nature. She orders Snow White to be killed in the woods, but when Snow White mysteriously disappears, the queen assumes she's dead-until she discovers otherwise and decides to handle things herself.

Directed by Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer), the film stars Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Andrew Burnap (Spare Room), and Tituss Burgess (Dolemite Is My Name).

This was an uneven film-not as bad as some are saying, but far from great. There were aspects I really enjoyed: Gal Gadot delivered a fantastic performance, the costumes were impressive, and the magical elements of the woods and the dwarfs' house were well done. I particularly liked the sequence of Snow White running through the forest.

Unfortunately, the film relies too heavily on CGI, which makes it feel hollow. The dwarfs, aside from Grumpy (who pretty much carried the film), lacked personality. The love interest was a complete misfire-his look and demeanor felt more like a Gap commercial than the rugged, Robin Hood-type character the story needed. The songs were more miss than hit, and while the ending was solid, the film as a whole just left me wanting more.

In conclusion, Snow White isn't a total waste of time, but it's far from the classic it could have been. I'd give it a 6/10.",6/10,wife caught snow white theaters evening story follows princess whose mother dies whose father remarries leaves war stepmother reveals true diabolical nature orders snow white killed woods snow white mysteriously disappears queen assumes discovers otherwise decides handle things directed marc webb days summer film stars rachel zegler west side story gal gadot wonder woman andrew burnap spare room tituss burgess dolemite name uneven bad saying far great aspects really enjoyed gal gadot delivered fantastic performance costumes impressive magical elements woods dwarfs house well done particularly liked sequence snow white running forest unfortunately film relies heavily cgi makes feel hollow dwarfs aside grumpy pretty much carried film lacked personality love interest complete look demeanor felt like gap commercial rugged robin character story needed songs miss hit ending solid film whole left wanting conclusion snow white total waste time far classic could give,0.9431,0.206,0.117,0.677
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is an absolute disaster, a lifeless, uninspired mess that should have never been made. It strips away everything magical about the original and replaces it with dull performances, awful CGI, and atrocious writing.

Rachel Zegler is a complete miscast. She lacks any warmth or charm, delivering her lines with the enthusiasm of a bored teenager forced to do homework. She doesn't embody Snow White-she looks and sounds like she doesn't even want to be there.

The CGI dwarfs are hideous. Instead of the beloved original characters, we get creepy, soulless abominations that look like they crawled out of a failed video game.

The script is a joke. It takes itself too seriously while also being completely forgettable. There's no heart, no magic-just bland, corporate-approved nonsense.

The visuals? Dull and artificial. The enchanted forest feels like a cheap green-screen set, and the costume design looks like something out of a bad school play.

The only saving grace is Gal Gadot. She's the one bright spot in this disaster, bringing elegance and presence to an otherwise soulless film. She deserved a better movie.

Disney should be ashamed of this mess. Watch the original instead-it's the only Snow White that matters.",1/10,disney snow white absolute disaster lifeless uninspired mess never made strips away everything magical original replaces dull performances awful cgi atrocious writing rachel zegler complete miscast lacks warmth charm delivering lines enthusiasm bored teenager forced homework embody snow looks sounds like even want cgi dwarfs hideous instead beloved original characters get creepy soulless abominations look like crawled failed video game script joke takes seriously also completely forgettable heart bland nonsense visuals dull artificial enchanted forest feels like cheap set costume design looks like something bad school play saving grace gal gadot one bright spot disaster bringing elegance presence otherwise soulless film deserved better movie disney ashamed mess watch original snow white matters,0.6249,0.296,0.242,0.461
"Honestly, this movie felt like a bland rehash of a story we've seen a hundred times. The characters were flat, the pacing dragged, and the ""modern twists"" just didn't land. Even the visuals, which could've saved it, were underwhelming. It's like they tried to reinvent the wheel and ended up with a triangle. Not worth the time.

Let's start with the characters. Snow White herself, played with little nuance, comes across more like a background character in her own story. She lacks the emotional depth or personality needed to carry the film, and unfortunately, the writing doesn't do her any favors either. The dialogue is stiff, forced, and at times painfully cringe-worthy, trying to sound modern and empowering but ending up awkward and shallow.

The Evil Queen, usually the highlight of any Snow White adaptation, is reduced here to a caricature. Her motivations are unclear, her presence is inconsistent, and the performance feels half-baked. It's hard to take her seriously when she flips between cartoonish villain and misunderstood anti-hero without any real development or justification. What could've been a complex antagonist ends up as one of the weakest parts of the movie.",1/10,honestly movie felt like bland rehash story seen hundred times characters flat pacing dragged modern twists land even visuals could saved underwhelming like tried reinvent wheel ended triangle worth time let start characters snow white played little nuance comes across like background character story lacks emotional depth personality needed carry film unfortunately writing favors either dialogue stiff forced times painfully trying sound modern empowering ending awkward shallow evil queen usually highlight snow white adaptation reduced caricature motivations unclear presence inconsistent performance feels hard take seriously flips cartoonish villain misunderstood without real development justification could complex antagonist ends one weakest parts movie,-0.8658,0.175,0.247,0.578

"I'm going to be completely honest - I didn't love it. In fact, I think Disney has well and truly lost its way. And before anyone jumps to the usual debates about casting or politics, that's not even the real issue here. The real problem is that these live-action remakes have become utterly soulless. They're missing the heart, the wonder, the sheer magic that made the originals so special.

'Snow White' should feel like a fairytale, something enchanting and timeless, but instead, this just felt... flat. The visuals were fine, the acting was actually decent, and the reimagining of the dwarfs (or ""magical companions"") wasn't as bad as I'd feared. But it all felt like a box-ticking exercise rather than a film made with love or passion.

Disney keeps trying to modernise these classics, but they seem to have forgotten why people fell in love with them in the first place.

"The Snow White remake is a huge disappointment. Disney removed the magic and charm of the original, replacing them with a dull and soulless version that barely resembles the classic.

"When I picture Snow White, a 14-year-old German princess with a fair and kind heart, I never envisioned a grown adult woman with a grating southwestern Valley Girl affectation. This thing might be Disney's biggest blunder in history, and I don't say that lightly. ""The Black Cauldron"" developed a passionate cult following. ""Home On the Range"" had some good soundtracks and Steve Buscemi. Disney's new remake of their 1930s animated classic just has absolutely no redeeming quality whatsoever, from this new pauper boy character shoehorned in awkwardly to attempt to appease angry fans of the original, to the offensively hideous CGI and derivative musical numbers where Rachel Zegler belches out her hopes and woes and dreams while staring up awkwardly into random space.

The cinematography is bad and aesthetic designs rely far too much on muted colours and digital padding to try and flesh out this rather dreary scenery into something more vibrant and alive. The costumes look absolutely foolish with the exception of Gal Gadot's. I know people keep on holding out hope for Disney, but we're all adults here, and we grew up. We have kids now who want to see new movies. Disney failed to grow up with us, and a new generation of children wants their 90s Disney Renaissance, but let's be honest here - they're not magical. Snow White is the result of nostalgia commodified, the byproduct of a multinational corporation that has given up on caring or never really cared at all. There's not even anything of value added to the story to make it fresh and new, they just took the original animated version's story and inbred it with a tired old warrior princess uprising resistance thing that ""Maleficent"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" have already used. You couldn't even pay me to watch this again, but on the bright side it might finally wake Disney up to the fact that they can't just coast by on nostalgic properties and overpriced theme parks anymore.",1/10,picture snow white german princess fair kind heart never envisioned grown adult woman grating southwestern valley girl affectation thing might disney biggest blunder history say lightly black cauldron developed passionate cult following home range good soundtracks steve buscemi disney new remake animated classic absolutely redeeming quality whatsoever new pauper boy character shoehorned awkwardly attempt appease angry fans original offensively hideous cgi derivative musical numbers rachel zegler belches hopes woes dreams staring awkwardly random space cinematography bad aesthetic designs rely far much muted colours digital padding try flesh rather dreary scenery something vibrant alive costumes look absolutely foolish exception gal gadot know people keep holding hope disney adults grew kids want see new movies disney failed grow us new generation children wants disney renaissance let honest magical snow white result nostalgia commodified byproduct multinational corporation given caring never really cared even anything value added story make fresh new took original animated version story inbred tired old warrior princess uprising resistance thing maleficent alice wonderland already used could even pay watch bright side might finally wake disney fact ca coast nostalgic properties overpriced theme parks anymore,0.9195,0.206,0.146,0.648
"I went into Snow White (2025) with an open mind, determined to ignore the negative hype and give Disney a chance to prove the doubters wrong. What a colossal mistake that was. This movie isn't just bad-it's a diabolical, cringe-inducing catastrophe that makes you wonder how a studio with this much money and history could churn out such an embarrassing pile of garbage. I'm genuinely stumped trying to find a single redeeming quality in this soulless cash grab.

Let's start with the visuals. The sets look like they were ripped from a low-budget video game, the CGI animals are laughably fake, and don't even get me started on the dwarfs. Whatever Disney was trying to pull with them-reimagined or not-it's an abomination. They're awkward, unnatural, and so poorly rendered I felt secondhand embarrassment for everyone involved. The enchanted forest? More like an over-filtered green screen nightmare. This is supposed to be Disney magic? It's a cheap, artificial mess that yanks you out of the story every five seconds.

Then there's Rachel Zegler as Snow White. Look, her singing voice is fine-great, even-but that's where the compliments end. Her acting is a disaster: stiff, forced, and completely devoid of the warmth or innocence that made Snow White iconic. She sleepwalks through the role like she's bored, delivering lines with all the charisma of a cardboard cutout. This isn't a sweet, kindhearted princess-it's a disinterested robot in a poorly styled wig. Speaking of which, what were they thinking with that hairstyle? And the costumes? They look like they were thrown together from a thrift store clearance bin. Snow White's outfit doesn't translate to live-action-it's a garish eyesore that screams ""we stopped trying."" But the real kicker? Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. She looks stunning, sure, but her performance is so atrocious she's practically guaranteed to sweep the Razzies. It's like she's auditioning for a parody instead of taking the role seriously. Every line she delivers is over-the-top in the worst way possible, making the character more laughable than menacing. She's the biggest catastrophe here, hands down.

Now, about the music. Zegler can sing, no doubt, but the new songs are so bland and generic, they might as well be elevator music. There's not a single tune that sticks with you or evokes any emotion. Compared to the timeless classics like ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" or ""Heigh-Ho,"" these new numbers are forgettable noise. Disney, what were you thinking? You had the chance to create something magical, and instead, you gave us this?

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) is a masterclass in how not to remake a classic. It's a lifeless, charm-less adaptation that strips away everything that made the original special. Disney, you've outdone yourself in all the wrong ways. This isn't just a bad movie-it's an insult to the legacy of Snow White and the audience's intelligence.

"Disney's 2025 live-action adaptation of ""Snow White,"" directed by Marc Webb, offers a fresh take on the classic tale, blending nostalgia with contemporary storytelling. Rachel Zegler shines in the titular role, embodying Snow White's innocence and strength with a captivating performance that breathes new life into the character. Opposite her, Gal Gadot delivers a compelling portrayal of the Evil Queen, exuding a chilling elegance that adds depth to the iconic villain.

The film introduces Andrew Burnap as Jonathan, a new character who serves as Snow White's ally and love interest. Burnap's chemistry with Zegler brings warmth and authenticity to their evolving relationship, providing a modern twist to the traditional narrative. The Seven Dwarfs are reimagined with a blend of voice acting and motion capture, featuring talents like Jeremy Swift (Doc), Tituss Burgess (Bashful), and Andrew Barth Feldman (Dopey), among others. This approach offers a unique visual representation, though it has sparked discussions regarding the use of CGI over practical casting.

Musically, the film balances classic melodies such as ""Whistle While You Work"" with new compositions by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Notably, the duet ""Princess Problems"" between Snow White and Jonathan stands out, reflecting their differing worldviews and adding depth to their characters. Visually, the movie enchants with lush landscapes and intricate set designs that immerse the audience in a fantastical realm.

However, the film is not without its critiques. Some viewers feel that the reliance on CGI for the dwarfs diminishes their charm, and certain modern updates may not resonate with all fans of the original. Despite these points, ""Snow White"" succeeds in delivering a heartfelt and visually stunning experience, honoring the legacy of the original while introducing thoughtful updates for a new generation.

In summary, ""Snow White"" (2025) stands as a testament to Disney's ability to reimagine its classics, offering a film that is both familiar and refreshingly new.

"This is not Snow White in any way-neither the story, the characters, nor the narrative. It should have just been named ""A Girl and an Evil Queen"".

I struggle to understand why studios drastically alter beloved stories instead of creating something new. A tale that has stood the test of time does so because of its themes, characters, and essence. Changing 80% of what made it a classic begs the question-why even call it the same story? At that point, it's less an adaptation and more a new narrative borrowing a familiar name.

It often seems like a marketing tactic, leveraging nostalgia and a built-in audience while delivering something barely recognizable. If they truly wanted to tell a fresh story, they could simply create one-perhaps ""inspired by"" the original. That way, they could modernize or innovate without alienating fans who love the classic for what it is.

Ironically, such drastic changes often lead to backlash rather than success. Fans feel betrayed, while new audiences may not connect with something that has lost its original magic.

"Snow White in 2025 is a soulless, uninspired cash grab that insults the intelligence of audiences. This ""reimagining"" of a beloved classic is a grotesque caricature, devoid of charm, artistry, or any semblance of originality.

Rachel Zegler, saddled with a thankless role, delivers a performance as flat as the film itself. Her Snow White is a pale imitation of the vibrant, iconic character we know and love. Gal Gadot, miscast as the Evil Queen, chews scenery with the subtlety of a bulldozer. Her campy villainy is neither frightening nor entertaining, merely laughable.

The CGI is a disaster. The ""dwarfs"" are an uncanny valley nightmare, a grotesque mockery of human beings. The lush, vibrant world of the original is replaced by a sterile, CGI-heavy landscape that feels more like a video game than a fairy tale.

The initial excitement of seeing a familiar story reimagined was swiftly replaced by a sense of melancholic recognition, a realization that this was less a creative inspiration and more a hollow echo of the original. This isn't to say the film was devoid of merit; certain visual elements were striking, and a few performances held promise. However, the overall experience was marred by a pervasive sense of missed opportunity.

The most glaring flaw was the film's jarring pacing. It felt as though crucial scenes were excised, leaving gaping holes in the narrative. Character development, a cornerstone of any compelling story, was sacrificed at the altar of brevity. Moments that should have resonated emotionally fell flat, due to the lack of necessary context and build-up. The relationship between the protagonist and their companions, intended to be a source of warmth and camaraderie, felt superficial and underdeveloped. Similarly, the antagonist's motivations, which could have been explored with nuance and depth, were reduced to a caricature of villainy. The film's insistence on adhering to the basic plot points of the original, while simultaneously rushing through them, resulted in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.

This sense of incompleteness was particularly disheartening considering the rich potential of the Snow White story. The themes of innocence, envy, and transformation are timeless, offering ample room for creative exploration. Yet, this film seemed content to merely skim the surface, failing to delve into the psychological complexities of its characters or the symbolic depth of its narrative. The ""inspired by"" label felt like a deceptive marketing ploy, a way to lure in audiences with the promise of something new, only to deliver a diluted and rushed imitation of a beloved classic.

Would I recommend this film to my friends? Absolutely not. The one-hour runtime, while seemingly efficient, felt like a disservice to the source material. It was a wasted hour, an hour that could have been spent engaging with a film that truly understood the essence of Snow White. Compared to the masterful adaptations of Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin-films that managed to both honor their origins and forge their own distinct identities-this film felt like a pale imitation. Those films understood that taking the original, and adding to it, and making it their own, is the key to a successful movie. This Snow White inspired film, however, falls short. It lacked the heart, the depth, and the creative spark necessary to truly capture the magic of the original tale, leaving a lingering sense of disappointment and a yearning for a more inspired and fulfilling cinematic experience.",1/10,good inspired snow white official snow white disappointed word movie feels inadequate describing reaction film marketed fresh take inspired classic tale quickly revealed disappointingly truncated seemingly rushed rendition disney snow white initial excitement seeing familiar story reimagined swiftly replaced sense melancholic recognition realization less creative inspiration hollow echo original say film devoid merit certain visual elements striking performances held promise however overall experience marred pervasive sense missed opportunity glaring flaw film jarring pacing felt though crucial scenes excised leaving gaping holes narrative character development cornerstone compelling story sacrificed altar brevity moments resonated emotionally fell flat due lack necessary context relationship protagonist companions intended source warmth camaraderie felt superficial underdeveloped similarly antagonist motivations could explored nuance depth reduced caricature villainy film insistence adhering basic plot points original simultaneously rushing resulted disjointed unsatisfying experience sense incompleteness particularly disheartening considering rich potential snow white story themes innocence envy transformation timeless offering ample room creative exploration yet film seemed content merely skim surface failing delve psychological complexities characters symbolic depth narrative inspired label felt like deceptive marketing ploy way lure audiences promise something new deliver diluted rushed imitation beloved classic would recommend film friends absolutely runtime seemingly efficient felt like disservice source material wasted hour hour could spent engaging film truly understood essence snow white compared masterful adaptations cinderella beauty beast managed honor origins forge distinct film felt like pale imitation films understood taking original adding making key successful movie snow white inspired film however falls short lacked heart depth creative spark necessary truly capture magic original tale leaving lingering sense disappointment yearning inspired fulfilling cinematic experience,0.9967,0.318,0.107,0.576
"Gone are the days of Disney magic. In its place are cheap CGI effects, uncanny valley troll monsters called dwarves, and terrible acting by the beautiful Gal Gadot. A sad rendition of an epic classic. Don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't.

Most of the dialogue is straight up exposition where the characters explain to the audience what's going on and how their world works. The unwritten rule of movie making is to show, not tell. Explaining things we don't care about gets old fast, and they do a lot of just that.

This movie sucks so bad it's almost impressive-like, how do you even fail this hard at a story everyone already knows? The acting was wooden enough to build a log cabin, the dialogue sounded like it was written by a toddler with a thesaurus, and the CGI looked like a cheap video game from 2003.

"Before going into this film, there was so much hate. Oh my gosh It was unbelievable, but I finally watched the movie in the cinemas and I must admit this film is way better than I expected. Rachel zegler does a phenomenal job as snow white and I think all the new songs are really great. She has a fantastic singing voice in my opinion. I love order new addition scenes. And I really do feel like they expanded and developed a world better than I could have ever imagined it to do.

The cinematography individuals were absolutely stunning. In my opinion, oh my gosh, the colours, the vibrancy delighting it all looks amazing, dude.

I like some of the new characters. They are more less supporting characters. They don't do a whole lot but they do their jobs supporting snow whites. I also do feel like galgado's does a great job at the which people hated her for some reason, saying her acting with stiff. Yeah, she has 1 or 2 awkward moments. But overall, it's more less faithful to the original smell white, which now the only problem I have. With the movie is 2 aspects, the 7 dwarfs. I do think that divisional presentation is faithful, but I do feel a bit mixed on the whole idea of using cgi. Instead of actually hiring little people to play The Doors, I know there's a whole backlash of controversy over that involving peat to think it's buts, it is what it is. I also feel like the ending was very anti. Climactic, it just sort of ended. I expected a big battle in the final act of the first original film in 1937. It was quite dark with the 7 dwalls doing what they did. But in this original new movie, the ending while it's really good And it's very fine. I do feel like I would have loved a bit more of a dramatic climax in my opinion, but it is what it is overall. I had a great time with a movie. I know people. I'm not going to like my review for this but I enjoyed it. I like what I like.

"For all the questionable controversies that the Internet created about this film long before it came out, with the only justifiable one being the more than understandable tiredness of the Disney live action remakes, now that I've seen it I say: what a bunch of fuss for nothing. Yes, there's not much here that deserves acclaim and there are clear problems, although none of them involve the controversies of the Internet, but in the end there is absolutely nothing here that deserves hate or controversy. Out of the Disney remakes so far this is nowhere near being one of the worst, in fact I'd say it's actually one of the best, even though it's not a very close competition in this club. It's a weird case because there's a lot to like here, but unfortunately there are many problems in the mix that prevent it from reaching its full potential, with two of them in particular that are quite substantial. The first is Gal Gadot who unfortunately is very bad in the film and just doesn't match with the rest of the cast, even with her beautiful looks. And the second is the extremely hideous design of the dwarves, which really gets in the way of some of the good scenes with them and I could never get used to it. The rest are just adjustments and improvements that I think would have polished the story better, given it more development and room to marinate properly. But fortunately, what saves the experience from all of this is that even if it never reaches perfection, the changes and messages made in this reimagining are still very interesting, and the main star manages to carry the film on her shoulders.

Rachel Zegler is truly wonderful here, you can see that she gave her body and soul to this role and she is the definition of a true Disney princess in the flesh, with the voice of an angel and charisma exploding on screen. She is probably the best Disney Princess of these new live action versions, not only because of the actress's work itself but because I liked everything they did to reimagine Snow White, a character I never loved. Instead of keeping the character archaic like in the original animated feature, or just changing everything about her, they managed to create an arc for her that maintains all the best qualities and essence of the character from the 1937 film, but still updating her for today. She sees herself as a helpless maiden who is incapable of solving things on her own, but through the course of the story she learns that she is more than capable of being brave and strong just as she is. She can help in a fight without knowing how to fight, she can fall in love with someone and still have her own agency, and she can very well achieve what she wants even though she's just someone who wants to be a good person and not step on others to do so, like the Evil Queen does. Not only do I think this is a great idea that keeps the character true to her origins with a modern twist, but it also sends a very smart and sweet message, especially to young girls who so far seem to be the audience that are enjoying the film the most, and for good reason.

Otherwise, I found the production to be mostly very solid and well cared for. The cinematography is full of vibrant colors which is refreshing compared to the many grey filled remakes we got, very detailed sets and surprisingly excellent CGI work. The kingdom itself is the only area that doesn't impress much, it just looks like another medieval kingdom with nothing that stands out, unlike the forests or the dwarves' house for example. The dwarves themselves, despite their terrible design, have some good moments as characters, especially with what they do to Dopey and the musical number ""Whistle While You Work"" which is the best moment of the film. The songs from the original were updated appropriately I would say, so that they could fit in with the new songs and have their own identity without clashing with their classic melodies. As for the new songs, I really liked ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""A Hand Meets a Hand"", and the musical number along with the melodies of ""All is Fair"" is pretty cool but Gal Gadot's singing unfortunately gets in the way. The rest is serviceable and has some cute moments of choreography or character interaction, but nothing too memorable beyond those I mentioned. And finally, I liked the change made to the prince, who here is a very different character and Andrew Burnap is charming in the role, but the group of bandits that accompanies him have little to do and could have easily been removed from the film.

In the end, despite my fears going into it, I enjoyed this new version of ""Snow White"", even if there is a lot in it that holds it back from being truly special. It's the kind of film that I want to give a higher score for the things I really liked about it, from the good messages to the excellent work of Zegler or the beautiful visuals. But it's undeniable that it is a turbulent experience with a lot of ups and downs. If you can forgive its missteps enough, there's plenty in here that I think is worth checking out, but I can understand those who could not get past them and end up not liking it. But considering the very low expectations I had, the fact that I got some positive and memorable stuff out of it already makes me quite happy, because there are valuable qualities in it that I really appreciated. I can totally see an audience for it that will really enjoy the experience, and despite having many reservations to make, I will certainly be more on the positive side. At least this remake tries to create something fresh without sacrificing everything from the original with some success, and even though it's not free from some of the old issues that all these remakes suffer from, it still manages to have more merits than many of them. I'll happily take more of this then another ""Lion King (2019)"" thank you very much.",6/10,questionable controversies internet created film long came justifiable one understandable tiredness disney live action remakes seen say bunch fuss nothing yes much deserves acclaim clear problems although none involve controversies internet end absolutely nothing deserves hate controversy disney remakes far nowhere near one worst fact say actually one best even though close competition club weird case lot like unfortunately many problems mix prevent reaching full potential two particular quite substantial first gal gadot unfortunately bad film match rest cast even beautiful looks second extremely hideous design dwarves really gets way good scenes could never get used rest adjustments improvements think would polished story better given development room marinate properly fortunately saves experience even never reaches perfection changes messages made reimagining still interesting main star manages carry film shoulders rachel zegler truly wonderful see gave body soul role definition true disney princess flesh voice angel charisma exploding screen probably best disney princess new live action versions actress work liked everything reimagine snow white character never loved instead keeping character archaic like original animated feature changing everything managed create arc maintains best qualities essence character film still updating today sees helpless maiden incapable solving things course story learns capable brave strong help fight without knowing fight fall love someone still agency well achieve wants even though someone wants good person step others like evil queen think great idea keeps character true origins modern twist also sends smart sweet message especially young girls far seem audience enjoying film good reason otherwise found production mostly solid well cared cinematography full vibrant colors refreshing compared many grey filled remakes got detailed sets surprisingly excellent cgi work kingdom area impress much looks like another medieval kingdom nothing stands unlike forests dwarves house example dwarves despite terrible design good moments characters especially dopey musical number whistle work best moment film songs original updated appropriately would say could fit new songs identity without clashing classic melodies new songs really liked waiting wish hand meets hand musical number along melodies fair pretty cool gal gadot singing unfortunately gets way rest serviceable cute moments choreography character interaction nothing memorable beyond mentioned finally liked change made prince different character andrew burnap charming role group bandits accompanies little could easily removed film end despite fears going enjoyed new version snow white even lot holds back truly special kind film want give higher score things really liked good messages excellent work zegler beautiful visuals undeniable turbulent experience lot ups downs forgive missteps enough plenty think worth checking understand could get past end liking considering low expectations fact got positive memorable stuff already makes quite happy valuable qualities really appreciated totally see audience really enjoy experience despite many reservations make certainly positive side least remake tries create something fresh without sacrificing everything original success even though free old issues remakes suffer still manages merits many happily take another lion king thank much,0.9996,0.385,0.078,0.537
"Rachel Ziegler and her acting type were truly miscast in this role, or the notes she was given were truly abhorred. At no time could I see my children liking her portrayal and personally, comparing to the original, it felt the entire tone of her performance was a miss.

As Ziegler doesn't seem able to envoke any form of sympathy from crowds it seems, maybe she'd be better suited sticking to supporting roles or another genre if fairytales aren't within her range.

There are always risks when deviating from the source material but honestly it just seemed like a better point of focus would have made a world of difference and perhaps some of the changes would have been welcomed with a more palatable lead to feed them to us.

"The new Snow White remake left me utterly unmoved and emotionally detached throughout. Instead of being swept up in the story, I found myself drifting back to childhood memories of watching the original, which only highlighted how lackluster this version feels in comparison.

"This remake of the cherished classic is, without a doubt, one of the most disappointing adaptations we've encountered in recent times. While the original tale of Snow White is a beloved story, endearing to both children and adults alike, this version seems heavily skewed towards an adult audience, but not in a favorable manner. It appears to be aimed at adults who harbor a desire to denigrate the original narrative rather than honor it. The essence of the original story, which captivated audiences with its charm and moral lessons, is utterly lost in this iteration. Disney, a studio renowned for crafting magical and timeless tales, seems to have missed the mark significantly with this production. The decision to produce such a film appears baffling, as it lacks the enchantment and whimsy that fans of the original would expect. Instead of evoking nostalgia and admiration, it leaves a sour taste, standing as an affront to the legacy of Snow White. The characters are poorly developed, the plot lacks coherence, and the visual aesthetics fail to capture the ethereal beauty synonymous with its predecessor. Overall, this rendition seems less like a homage and more like a misguided attempt that strays far from what made the original a masterpiece. It's a shame that Disney, with its vast resources and creative expertise, would choose to release a movie that feels more like a parody than a respectful reimagining of such a treasured story.",1/10,remake cherished classic without doubt one disappointing adaptations encountered recent times original tale snow white beloved story endearing children adults alike version seems heavily skewed towards adult audience favorable manner appears aimed adults harbor desire denigrate original narrative rather honor essence original story captivated audiences charm moral lessons utterly lost iteration disney studio renowned crafting magical timeless tales seems missed mark significantly production decision produce film appears baffling lacks enchantment whimsy fans original would expect instead evoking nostalgia admiration leaves sour taste standing affront legacy snow white characters poorly developed plot lacks coherence visual aesthetics fail capture ethereal beauty synonymous predecessor overall rendition seems less like homage like misguided attempt strays far made original masterpiece shame disney vast resources creative expertise would choose release movie feels like parody respectful reimagining treasured story,0.9937,0.357,0.063,0.58
"Costume Design Inconsistencies:

A notable example is the character Jonathan's attire, which includes a modern jean jacket and hoodie. This choice clashes with the film's intended fantasy setting, leading to a disjointed visual experience.

Visual Effects and Character Representation:

The depiction of the seven dwarfs through CGI has been a point of contention. The animated dwarfs resemble lawn gnomes, which some viewers found awkward and lacking the charm of the original characters.

Narrative and Tonal Issues:

The film introduces complex new subplots but struggles to maintain a consistent tone. This results in a narrative that feels disjointed and fails to engage the audience effectively.

Character Portrayals:

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen has been criticized for lacking menace, with her performance oscillating between menacing and campy, leading to an inconsistent character depiction.

"If you want to preserve the cherished memories of your childhood, I strongly advise against watching this movie. Some stories are best left untouched, remaining as beautiful, nostalgic moments in our minds. However, this film takes those beloved memories and distorts them into something unrecognizable. If you grew up loving the original tale, this adaptation may leave you feeling disappointed, disheartened, or even frustrated.

Furthermore, if you have children and are considering taking them to see this movie, you may want to think twice. Children are especially sensitive to visuals, and this film, rather than offering a magical, heartwarming experience, may instead introduce them to unnecessary fear. If your goal is to protect them from nightmares, then it would be wise to choose another film, one that truly embodies the spirit of wonder and adventure that fairy tales are meant to inspire. Rather than enchanting young viewers, this movie might unsettle them, leaving them with eerie images rather than joyful dreams.

One of the few redeeming qualities of the film might be the seven CGI dwarfs. In a movie that struggles in many other aspects, the visual effects team seems to have done a commendable job in bringing these characters to life. The animation and rendering of the dwarfs are well-executed, offering some of the only moments of genuine charm throughout the film. While CGI in modern films can often feel artificial or lifeless, the dwarfs in this adaptation manage to have some personality and visual appeal, providing at least a small highlight in an otherwise lackluster experience.

However, impressive CGI alone is not enough to save a film that falters in storytelling, character development, or emotional depth. While the technology used to create the dwarfs might be impressive, it does little to mask the shortcomings of the film as a whole. A movie should offer more than just visual spectacle-it should captivate, inspire, and transport its audience into a world worth believing in. Unfortunately, this adaptation fails to achieve that, leaving viewers with little more than a sense of disappointment.

In the end, if you value the magic and purity of the story you once knew, this film might not be the right choice for you. There are plenty of other adaptations and interpretations of classic fairy tales that do justice to their original magic and wonder. Instead of risking the disappointment that this movie might bring, consider revisiting the versions of the story that made you fall in love with it in the first place. Whether it's an animated classic, a beautifully written book, or even a stage adaptation, there are countless ways to experience the magic of this story without subjecting yourself to an underwhelming film.

For those who are still curious about the movie, perhaps the best approach is to manage expectations. If you go in expecting a faithful, heartfelt adaptation, you might leave feeling let down. But if you watch it with the understanding that it may take creative liberties, alter the tone, and possibly even stray far from the heart of the original, then you might be able to find small moments of enjoyment-especially in the CGI work. Just don't expect it to leave you with the same warmth and wonder that the original story once did.

Ultimately, the choice is yours, but be prepared. Whether it's protecting your childhood memories or shielding young viewers from unsettling imagery, there are valid reasons to be cautious about this film. If nothing else, at least we can acknowledge that the visual effects team put in the effort to make the seven dwarfs look good.

This was, without a doubt, the worst Disney film I have ever seen. The storyline lacked heart, the pacing was off, and the emotional core that usually defines a Disney movie was nowhere to be found. But the most shocking part of all was Gal Gadot's performance. Her acting was stiff and unconvincing, completely devoid of the warmth or depth that the character required. It was painfully clear that she was miscast, and her presence only dragged the film further down.

What makes it worse is the fact that this movie tried to build on a beloved original - and failed miserably. Instead of honoring what made the original special, it felt like a hollow imitation, filled with glossy visuals but no soul. It was not just a letdown - it was almost offensive to fans who hold the original dear.

If it were possible to give a negative rating, I wouldn't hesitate. Watching this movie felt like a waste of time, and I genuinely regret pressing play. My advice? Spare yourself the disappointment. Skip this one entirely.",1/10,always huge fan disney movies magic music memorable characters part life since childhood sat watch film genuinely excited hopeful unfortunately excitement quickly turned disappointment end left complete disbelief without doubt worst disney film ever seen storyline lacked heart pacing emotional core usually defines disney movie nowhere found shocking part gal gadot performance acting stiff unconvincing completely devoid warmth depth character required painfully clear miscast presence dragged film makes worse fact movie tried build beloved original failed miserably instead honoring made original special felt like hollow imitation filled glossy visuals soul letdown almost offensive fans hold original dear possible give negative rating would hesitate watching movie felt like waste time genuinely regret pressing play advice spare disappointment skip one entirely,0.9278,0.31,0.21,0.48
"When the Queen looks at her magic mirror it clearly is faulty and probably delivered from a cheap knock-off from the real thing.

Gal Gadot is a goddess in every sense a beautiful woman, who should have no issues getting jealous of another woman's looks.

Rachel Zegler is just average, not someone I'd crawl over broken glass with my flies open to try and bag a kiss from.

Here the fundamental flaws in the films logic are laid bare, Rachel can sing .. but that's about it.

The film after its disastrous reshoots which meant it was delayed for over a year, it manages to shoehorn in some horrendous cgi dwarves along with bandits ???. Bandits ????, now forgive me but I do not recall these being in the original. It's pretty evident that these were the original magical beings or poor substitutes for the dwarves and the film couldn't structurally exist without them due to the footage that had already been filmed.

The film follows certain beats from the original initially before deciding it wants to be something else, and the mediocre songs do not help either.

You also know there's a massive issue with the film when they've literally dropped the 'Seven Dwarfs' from the title and simply called it 'Snow White'. The holy grail of the Disney legacy is subsequently crucified in the name of a modern re-invention of the classic and believe me I am furious that Disney didn't have the respect for the original and hired an actress in the lead who has nothing but contempt for it. Rachel has made that clear from her big mouth in numerous press junkets where they let her open it.

"Oh boy, Disney's Snow White-where do I even start? This movie is like a poisoned apple that looks shiny on the outside but leaves you gagging after one bite. First off, Snow White herself is so annoyingly chipper, I half-expected her to break into a sales pitch for a timeshare with those woodland critters. Speaking of which, those animals deserve an Oscar for tolerating her off-key warbling while they scrub floors-meanwhile, I'm over here wishing the Evil Queen would hurry up with the inevitable.

The dwarves? More like seven little reasons to question my life choices. Grumpy's the only one with a brain, and even he couldn't save this snooze-fest. The plot moves slower than Sleepy after a double espresso wears off, and the Prince? Dude shows up for five seconds, kisses a coma patient without consent, and we're supposed to call it romance. Disney magic? More like Disney tragic. I'd rather watch paint dry-at least it wouldn't whistle while it worked. Two stars, and that's just for the Queen's mirror, who clearly knew how to throw shade.

In short, what a Total disaster and catastrophe . I can't imagine so much money and efforts were poured into this junk. This actress, the plots and pretty much everything in the movie were terrible.

"Well, basically-they fail on the basics.

What really caught me off guard was who ended up disappointing me the most. I went in expecting issues elsewhere, but surprisingly, it was Gal Gadot who stood out in all the wrong ways. I genuinely didn't expect her to be the weak link, but her performance felt undercooked and surprisingly rookie for someone of her experience. It lacked the depth and presence you'd hope for, especially given the iconic role she was playing.

Then there's the scenery-or rather, the lack of it. It felt lazy and uninspired, like they cut corners on the visuals that are supposed to give fairy tales their magic. The sets didn't pull you into the world; they pushed you out of it.

And don't even get me started on the costume design. It was oddly offbeat, almost like the characters were wearing outfits from a different movie entirely. The clothing lacked that timeless, fantastical charm and instead came across as cheap or hastily thrown together.

Overall, it just didn't click. It's disappointing when a classic like Snow White gets a retelling that misses the mark on all the fundamentals-acting, visuals, and atmosphere.",1/10,well fail basics really caught guard ended disappointing went expecting issues elsewhere surprisingly gal gadot stood wrong ways genuinely expect weak link performance felt undercooked surprisingly rookie someone experience lacked depth presence hope especially given iconic role playing rather lack felt lazy uninspired like cut corners visuals supposed give fairy tales magic sets pull world pushed even get started costume design oddly offbeat almost like characters wearing outfits different movie entirely clothing lacked timeless fantastical charm instead came across cheap hastily thrown together overall click disappointing classic like snow white gets retelling misses mark visuals atmosphere,-0.3182,0.193,0.196,0.611

"My Review- Snow White In Cinemas now My Rating 8/10 First some background to one of the most trouble plagued movies to almost never hit the screen however it's here at last and I and my favourite movie partner really enjoyed it.

Isn't it ironic that the 1938 classic cartoon feature Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was widely credited with saving Walt Disney Animation Studios from financial ruin and launching the ""Disney Renaissance"" in 2025 is their biggest liability if it bombs at the box office .

The estimated production budget including marketing of this new live feature version of Snow White is could reach between $300 million and $470 million USD so to make a profit would need to make $700 million at the World Wide box office .

The original 1938 cartoon feature had an estimated production budget of $USD 1.5 million and world box office is approximately an outstanding $USD 185 million.

The plagued journey of this semi live action of Snow White to the screen began back in 2019 when pre production was held up due to Covid since then there have been setbacks by the far right purists following comments by Peter Dinklage alleging the original film depicted the dwarfs in a negative light, Disney announced on January 25, 2022, that they would approach the characters differently, while also consulting members of the dwarfism community. Many fans of the original including Dylan Postl pointed out that many of Dinklage's remarks were incorrect. For one, he said the dwarfs lived in a cave. They actually lived in a very nice cottage and worked in a diamond mine.

There's been much more behind the scenes drama since then you can't please everyone if you expect the exact story featured in the superb 1938 Academy Award animated feature think again because the creative team on this 21st Century version have I think very cleverly turned Snow White into a heroine that little girls and young women can be proud of .

Rachel Zegler is perfect for the role she's not saccharine sweet however her portrayal of the outcast princess who's life is spared by the woodsman sent to kill her and return her heart to her evil stepmother now Queen has strength and conviction.

The evil Queen played so well by Gal Gadot is suitably sinister as she vainly consults her magic mirror . In this new version like others in the cast she even gets a new very effective song and production number.

These new songs that fit in well with the few much loved songs from the original like Heigh Ho Heigh Ho ,Whistle While You Work were composed by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul of La La Land (2016), The Greatest Showman (2017), and the Tony award winning Broadway musical ""Dear Evan Hansen"".

Apart from Snow White the most loved characters of course in the story are The Seven little men whose untidy cottage becomes Snow Whites refuge.

In this version they are equally loveable their GGI forms known as (motion capture/puppeteer unlike the original cartoon version the actors providing their voices all get screen credit and deserve it they provide Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey ,especially Dopey in this version their charm and humour.

Snow White in this version isn't stuck at home cleaning house for seven men she's off on a quest to try and locate her banished father on the way she is befriended by a dashing Robin Hood like outlaw called Jonathan and his not so merry men I thought this worked well as they are rebels who want to defy the Evil Queen's monarchy Jonathan is a new character played with great charm by Andrew Burnap and created for the film as Snow White's love interest (partially based on the Prince from the original film) however Snow White in this new version is not looking for romance or rescue by any Prince she's a young independent woman who is on a quest to save her kingdom from her wicked step mother.

If you are expecting a faithful retelling of The famous 1812 Brothers Grim fairy tale or a live action faithful version of the 1938 Cartoon feature you might be disappointed.

New interpretations of classic stories by Shakespeare ,Ibsen, Voltaire Tolstoy and all great authors have been in production for ever so this new retelling of a classic much loved story I hope proves its detractors wrong and I hope it's a great success.

Congratulations to Director Marc Webb and Erin Cressida Wilson who wrote this reimagined version of Jacob and Wilhelmina Grimm's classic .

Her attempt to modernize the character with an empowered edge feels forced and unnatural, while her singing, though technically strong, lacks soul and fails to elevate the forgettable new songs.

The evil queen didnt really feel like that character was delivered very well and the 7 dwarfs did look a little scary.

"Outside of all of the bias for the film, it is clear that the movie was meant to be one story, but attempted to add parts of the original. The first story planned for this adaptation was mixed into the first animated film, creating a confusing climax and resolution. Also, the main point of removing the Prince from the 1937 movie was to make it clear that Snow White was independent and did not need a man to save her. Even if a princess falls in love with a powerful man, she is no weaker than a single one. For example, Mulan was the hero of China but still had a love interest that had a role in the army. She is considered the most skilled princess, even if she has a lover. After the backlash against this change, they replaced the Prince with a bandit (sounds like Aladdin, no?). The soundtrack bears little resemblance to the original film rather than creating supposedly new, empowering songs. While the costumes show the magic of Disney, the only one that resembles the original film is Snow White's dress, with the others bearing a slight resemblance to their counterparts. The terrifying CGI of the dwarfs appears quickly made to meet the planned release date, Rachel Zegler has little-to-no resemblance to the original Snow White (especially in the singing. Where is her famous whistle-like voice?), and Gal Gadot's performance does not appear worth 15 million dollars.

"Something is off, wery off.

I just have an eerie feeling in my mind, and I know exactly why.

Skipping the story, going directly to the glaring issue.

The film never connects with me as a viewer. Something always reminds me that what I am seeing is fake. And sure, I know that Alien, ET, Terminator and Avatar also was fake, but there are key differences to those movies and Snow white. I love Terminator, one of the best action movies ever mad. And Avatar left me disappointed with the real world, to gray and boring.

Snow White, it never connects.

The story is written as if it's only purpose is to meet the schedule or budget. Write something that fits into 1 hour and 45 minutes.

The acting feels forced and like Rachel said: I didn't like the original movie. Translation: I want fame and money, but I dont care for the movie or viewer.

And storytelling, just fits the standard Hollywood motto. Nothing that challenge or makes me connect.

And the sets, everything feels and looks fake. An edited Rachel in an edited Forrest, with fake elves.

"Disney's Snow White is an absolute trainwreck, managing to fumble everything from storytelling to casting to visual effects. The so called modern update strips away all the charm, heart, and magic of the original, leaving behind a hollow, uninspired mess that alienates fans while failing to offer anything meaningful in return.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the warmth and innocence that made the character iconic, and the film's attempt to turn her into a strong and independent leader feels forced and out of place. The dwarfs have been controversially reimagined in a way that removes their personality, and the absence of a real Prince entirely erases one of the story's core elements. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, while visually striking, delivers a performance that is more stale than menacing.

The CGI is embarrassingly bad for a blockbuster of this scale, and the film's attempts at humor fall flat. Worst of all, it lacks the timeless magic that made Disney's classic fairy tales so beloved.

"I was there watched this movie, and it this movie, and it was absolute disappointed. Why i'm use words "" A Live action Disney Folly"". Compared to the original version, Snow White and the Seven dwarfs animated version is better than the remakes. Disney has continued to prove that live-action remakes of classic animated tales are getting tiresome and unoriginal. As Gold Member of D23, rachel zegler is the one who blame with, she's disrespecting the movie ever since she put her mouth at the D23 Expo 2 years ago and i'm tired of being humbled I'm tired to be speechless, if Walt is alive, he'll fire her for good.

Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive and even worse, disrespecting the original animate movie. Snow White is one of those dull ones Absolute horrid . Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial.

Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here. The choice of using CGI dwarfs really was a bad idea because it came off as quite uncanny and unintentionally creepy to observe at times.

The performances....aren't very great. Rachel Zegler does give her best as she does have solid moments including some of the voice performances from the other cast. Gal Gadot, however, her performance really didn't work at all. Gadot lacks the emotion and creep charm to what the Evil Queen should have been. Queen should have been.

Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm Casting Rachel

Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her. Her line delivery feels forced, and there's little emotional connection between her and the world she's supposed to inhabit.

Weak CGI and Bland Visuals: For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI is shockingly subpar.

The enchanted forest, which should have felt lush and immersive, looks artificial, and the CGI creatures lack the expressiveness and charm of their animated counterparts.

The dwarfs-who have been controversially reimagined-look awkward and unnatural, making it hard to emotionally invest in their presence. The visual effects in Snow White feel rushed, and instead of enhancing the experience, they serve as a constant distraction.

Music: A Forgettable Soundtrack The one highlight o film is Zegler's singing, but even that can't save the uninspired and generic new songs. Unlike Disney's previous

Despite some good looking designs on the backgrounds and all, it was really boring. Marc Webb tries his best but unfortunately, really little about this would ever work.

Please, audiences for gods sake. Stop giving the remakes a chance. Save the money and go watch Snow White and the seven dwarfs (1937) instead of the live action Disney folly.

"I took my niece to see this movie and was not too thrilled with the storyline and its complete departure from the actual storyline. We found the main Snow White character to be off putting. And that doesn't even include the unprofessional and offensive comments that have been said by this woman. I really don't know how Disney could allow this disaster to move forward.

"Disney's 2025 live-action Snow White is an absolute trainwreck-easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. It manages to butcher a beloved classic with uninspired performances, baffling creative choices, and some of the worst casting decisions in recent memory.

Let's start with the biggest disaster of them all: Gal Gadot. Somehow, she delivers an even worse performance than in Wonder Woman 1984-which I didn't think was possible. As the Evil Queen, she's neither menacing nor captivating; she's just painfully bad. Her line delivery is wooden, her facial expressions are awkward, and her attempt at villainous charm is laughable. At times, it feels like she's struggling just to remember her lines, and her singing? It's borderline offensive. She completely lacks the gravitas needed for the role, making every scene she's in a chore to sit through. Disney needs to do everyone a favor and never cast her in a major role again.

Rachel Zegler, as Snow White, is equally lifeless. She doesn't embody the warmth or charm of the original character, instead coming off as entitled and irritating. The chemistry between her and the Prince (or whatever they tried to turn the love interest into) is non-existent. The film's attempt to modernize Snow White by removing core elements of her story makes her character feel directionless, further dragging the already weak script down.

Visually, the movie is an eyesore. The CGI dwarfs look atrocious, the sets lack any kind of magical charm, and the whole film has this weird, cheap, over-processed aesthetic that makes it look more like a straight-to-streaming knockoff than a $200+ million Disney blockbuster.

And let's not forget the music. The new songs are completely forgettable, adding nothing of value to the film. Meanwhile, any attempt at nostalgia with the classic songs is ruined by poor arrangements and even worse performances.

If Disney was hoping this would breathe new life into their live-action remakes, they've failed miserably. Snow White (2025) is an insult to the original and a complete waste of time. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.",1/10,disney snow white absolute one worst films ever seen manages butcher beloved classic uninspired performances baffling creative choices worst casting decisions recent memory let start biggest disaster gal gadot somehow delivers even worse performance wonder woman think possible evil queen neither menacing captivating painfully bad line delivery wooden facial expressions awkward attempt villainous charm laughable times feels like struggling remember lines singing borderline offensive completely lacks gravitas needed role making every scene chore sit disney needs everyone favor never cast major role rachel zegler snow white equally lifeless embody warmth charm original character instead coming entitled irritating chemistry prince whatever tried turn love interest film attempt modernize snow white removing core elements story makes character feel directionless dragging already weak script visually movie eyesore cgi dwarfs look atrocious sets lack kind magical charm whole film weird cheap aesthetic makes look like knockoff million disney blockbuster let forget music new songs completely forgettable adding nothing value film meanwhile attempt nostalgia classic songs ruined poor arrangements even worse performances disney hoping would breathe new life remakes failed miserably snow white insult original complete waste time favor avoid costs,-0.9506,0.207,0.266,0.527

"Snow White, the latest in Disney's line of uninspiring remakes, is an effort that slightly surpassed my expectations. Not something I think will be fondly remembered, but the vitriol in reaction to its existence seems especially unearned.

The writing is quite average, but I appreciate that it tries a somewhat fresh take. While not diverging too much from the basic narrative of the 1937 film, it tries to add depth to Snow White and the substitute Prince character and extends the runtime by some other means. Not groundbreaking, but I at least felt like I was watching an actual re-adaptation of the source material instead of just a CGI'd up live action rendition of the original movie. Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella was one where it stuck very close to the original while barely adding anything of substance, making it feel hollow despite very nice filmmaking. Sure, I'd say it's a better overall film than this Snow White, but the latter is the format I would prefer a remake to follow.

The technical aspects of the movie could have been improved upon. The cinematography and color grading do very little to make it a visually exciting experience although nothing was distractingly bad. The visual effects, however, were distracting. The animals take on a cartoonish appearance but that only serves to make them look fake the entire time. The dwarfs are the worst offender; their designs are just unappealing and there's a degree of uncomfortability every time they're on screen, especially Dopey. The ""Heigh-Ho"" sequence, which is likely 100% CGI, is probably the worst part of the movie. Making the dwarfs live action would probably have made the movie overall more palatable.

The music is solidly executed. It does away with a large part of the music from the 1937 film, and the new songs are alright. I think I would've preferred the music to sound ""bigger"", and there is some noticeable autotune, but I found this movie to definitely handle music better than some of the other remakes.

Snow White is just another Disney remake but I found it justifies its existence more than some others in the lineup. I've seen almost all of the recent ones and I definitely prefer the likes of Pete's Dragon and Dumbo to Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. Snow White isn't particularly impressive, but it did hold my attention and my impression was overall positive despite some hiccups.",6/10,snow white latest disney line uninspiring remakes effort slightly surpassed expectations something think fondly remembered vitriol reaction existence seems especially unearned writing quite average appreciate tries somewhat fresh take diverging much basic narrative film tries add depth snow white substitute prince character extends runtime means groundbreaking least felt like watching actual source material instead cgi live action rendition original movie kenneth branagh cinderella one stuck close original barely adding anything substance making feel hollow despite nice filmmaking sure say better overall film snow white latter format would prefer remake follow technical aspects movie could improved upon cinematography color grading little make visually exciting experience although nothing distractingly bad visual effects however distracting animals take cartoonish appearance serves make look fake entire time dwarfs worst offender designs unappealing degree uncomfortability every time screen especially dopey sequence likely cgi probably worst part movie making dwarfs live action would probably made movie overall palatable music solidly executed away large part music film new songs alright think would preferred music sound bigger noticeable autotune found movie definitely handle music better remakes snow white another disney remake found justifies existence others lineup seen almost recent ones definitely prefer likes pete dragon dumbo beauty beast lion king snow white particularly impressive hold attention impression overall positive despite hiccups,0.9856,0.224,0.085,0.692

"For a movie steeped in the rich legacy of Disney's animated classic, Snow White 2025 falls flat in almost every department. Despite the potential for a modern, enchanting live-action remake, this film feels overly artificial and devoid of genuine magic.

The sets and visuals seem contrived, leaving the audience longing for the lush, immersive environments of the animated original. The portrayal of the dwarfs, which should have been charming and central to the story's heart, comes across as uninspired and awkwardly handled.

Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen is a major disappointment. While her striking appearance is undeniable, her portrayal lacks the depth and menace needed to embody such an iconic antagonist. Moreover, Snow White's costume design and hairstyle feel strangely out of place, failing to evoke the timeless elegance of the character.

The musical elements, a key part of Disney's charm, lack the memorable tunes and emotional resonance audiences hope for. The overall film suffers from a lack of coherence, making the experience more cringe-worthy than captivating.

Disney has certainly taken bold creative liberties here, but unfortunately, most of them miss the mark.

"I honestly don't know why Disney insist on doing Live Action remakes of their much loved cartoon films. While some of them have been quite good interpretations like 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Lion King', possibly because they follow the same storyline as the original, this one is truly awful.

I didn't think it could be as bad as the reviews are saying, but it really is.

"It appears that Snow White 2025 can't even escape the apparent IMDb manipulation by bots to dramatically drive down its ratings and the Israeli-Palestinian controversy and casting Rachel Zegler whose American father and Columbian mother creating a ""non-white"" character backlash. Even with these controversies aside it is hard not to ignore the current political divide for those aware of the emotional turmoil besetting the United States and the plotline of the movie as dramatically displayed on screen. Nevertheless in sending these non-cinematic concerns to the backseat, this movie has its rich musical, lyrical charm, strong singing numbers, and a harder dramatic edge that even appears to have some young children captivated. There is plenty of wry humor, timely musical numbers, and good pacing except for a moment in the middle of the movie and one musical number that could easily have been edited out. The underlying message of cooperation, fairness, and kindness, and, yes, getting along with others from all walks of life form a backbone of this movie in the form of Rachel Zegler as the titular Snow White. Gal Gadot also offers up a strong evil character with her own snazzy musical piece and performance as the wicked stepmother and sometimes creepy, appealing hag.

"I was wondering how different would Disney's remake of its animated classic be, and it turns out to be really different. Instead of a Prince Charming, this time we have a bandit king. And Dopey, who looks like a cute version of Dobby from Harry Potter, turns out to actually be spunky.

The wicked Queen is played by the glamorous Gal Gadot, who is clearly relishing the chance to be a baddie. She is the fun one to watch. Rachel Zegler inhabits the titular role with sufficient conviction.

The songs by Pasek and Paul are not as memorable as their earlier works, although their version of Heigh-Ho is at least clever and feisty.

The biggest letdown has to be the kiss that broke the magic spell. It is supposed to be a true love's kiss but what we see is such a weak and hesitant attempt it is truly a miracle that it was enough to wake the unconscious princess.

"Another major failure for Disney. How can anyone think this was going to be good? Let's see...

First, let's cast an abrasive Snow White who isn't that attractive, who hates the original 1937 movie and puts it down publicly, who insults over half the population of the USA, is a loudmouth with her political views alienating countless people, and who has marginal talent at best. Not too smart.

Second, let's take out the actual dwarves and put in full-sized people instead. When that doesn't work, let's then CGI the dwarves in, because Hollywood Head Dwarf Peter Dinklage doesn't like any other dwarves in Hollywood getting much-needed jobs but him. After Dinklage's ""outrage"" at Disney possibly actually having dwarf actors in a retitled ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,"" CGI was used instead, and seven actors won't be getting Disney paychecks. Dinklage goes against his own people, what a guy!

Third, let's ""update"" a timeless story and very successful tale for ""modern"" audiences, at the same time ignoring that the ""modern"" audiences love the 1937 original, unlike the actress playing Snow White.

And quite a few other things.....what could go wrong?

Disney obviously had too much money in this to throw it away, otherwise it really should have gone the way of, say, ""Batgirl"" which supposedly was so bad that Warner Brothers simply refused to release it in theaters or anywhere. But that was ""only"" $90 million, much less than what ""Snow White"" costs, especially including marketing.

If one really has to see this, spare yourself the expense, but out of curiosity maybe glance at it when it eventually streams on Disney if you already have their channel.

But ""Snow White"" exists, and will surely be joke fodder for years to come.

"When it comes to adapting beloved classics for a modern audience, there's a tightrope to walk-one that balances reverence for the original with the demands of contemporary sensibilities. Unfortunately, the recent remake of Snow white stumbles badly on this tightrope, leaving fans like me longing for the unadulterated brilliance of the original. The plea is simple: the original movie was way better, and it's time to bring back the storyline that made it a timeless gem. Modernizing classics is a tricky endeavor, no doubt, but it has to be done right-or not at all.

The original movie, released decades ago, captured something pure and inimitable. Its storyline was a masterclass in specific genre or theme, e.g., suspense, romance, or adventure, weaving together key elements like character depth, pacing, or atmosphere into a narrative that resonated deeply. The characters felt alive, their motivations grounded in a world that made sense within the story's framework. It wasn't just entertainment; it was an experience-one that lingered long after the credits rolled. That magic, however, is glaringly absent in this latest iteration.

Where the original thrived on authenticity, the remake drowns in a sea of forced modernization. The decision to overhaul the classic storyline feels less like an evolution and more like a betrayal. Gone are the specific plot points or themes, e.g., slow-burn tension or heartfelt simplicity that defined the first film, replaced by a frenetic, trend-chasing mess that prioritizes flash over substance. It's as if the filmmakers decided that today's audiences couldn't handle the elegance of the original pacing or the nuance of its conflicts. Instead, we get specific examples, e.g., unnecessary subplots, CGI-heavy action, or shallow character reboots that clash with the soul of what made the movie special.

Modernizing a classic isn't inherently a bad idea-times change, and so do tastes. But there's a right way to do it, and this isn't it. Take a film like example of a successful remake, where updates enhanced the core story without sacrificing its essence. Those adaptations respected their source material, using new technology or perspectives to amplify what was already great. In contrast, this remake seems to misunderstand why the original worked. It's not enough to slap a fresh coat of paint on a masterpiece and call it progress; you have to honor the foundation while building something new. Here, the foundation feels bulldozed.

The performances, too, pale in comparison. The original cast brought a raw, unpolished energy that grounded the story-think specific actor or scene. The remake's actors, while talented, are saddled with dialogue and motivations that feel focus-grouped to death, stripping away the humanity that once shone through. Even the visuals, though technically impressive, lack the heart of the original's e.g., practical effects or cinematography. It's a textbook case of style over substance, a hollow echo of what came before.

Fans aren't asking for a shot-for-shot rehash-nostalgia alone doesn't sustain a film. But we deserve a return to the storyline that captivated us: one that trusts its audience, leans into its strengths, and doesn't bow to every modern trope. The modernization of classics can work when handled with care, but this remake proves that carelessness leads to disappointment. So here's a plea to the filmmakers: shelve the gimmicks, revisit the original blueprint, and give us back the story we fell in love with.

I never thought would root for the apple, but Snow White is just so bad, it would have been better to have put her out of her misery.

The evil queen is much more attractive and doesn't make sense that she would even be remotely envious of the actress who plays Snow White.

"Not great.

Let's just say that you will not be at the edge of your seat. There is no suspense at all at any point Too long and dragged out yet the ending is garbled. It felt like somewhere closer to the end of the second hour the creators said ""Hey, would you look at the time! Certainly time to finish this thing!"" So they did... In general, the queen was just not scary or evil enough. Snow White was not inspiring enough. Gal Gadot's performance was mediocre at best. Rachel's singing was good but acting lacked authenticity. The ""prince"" who wasn't even a prince was not likable. Just a guy off the street who played his rather confusing role poorly. It is hard to understand why the main characters supposedly fall in love with each other. There wasn't a point when a spark between them is seen. No chemistry whatsoever.

7 dwarfs who, it seems, were supposed to be some magical creatures, which would justifying their grotesque appearance, coexist with actual characters with dwarfism which is odd. Where did both types of ""dwarfs"" come from??

"This is a very sad review for me to write. I grew up with the original Disney classic animation films as a foundation or bedrock of my childhood. What I just saw would have Disney himself spinning in his grave. Everything about this movie is bad, but I have to say the performances of the main leads is really where it goes off the rails and into a sewer. Rachel Zegler might have talent, I don't know. But it certainly isn't clear from this film. She seemed an odd choice to play this role however. Gal Gadon't know how to act, on the other hand, this woman is bad. She can't act. I've seen her in half a dozen streamer films and it's the same schtick each time, and here we are again, the same schtick. She can't act, folks, it's as simple and as sad as that.

"I was initially very excited to see this movie. Considering I was never a big fan of the animated Snow White, I thought: how could they make it any worse? Well, somehow, they managed to succeed at that. I've always loved the live action Princess movies Disney would put out -except for Maleficent- but this was miserable. It lacked all the joy of a Disney film. The script was incredibly messy, and the acting was poor. Rachel Zegler was great for the most part and had a wonderful singing voice, but Gal Gadot was the worst Evil Queen I've ever seen. And Jonathan's outfits were hideous. The romance between Jonathan and Snow was supposed to be improved upon, but somehow made worse. The choreography was non existent, especially because this is a Disney musical. Some of the songs were good, but the lack of an interesting setting to them was it's downfall.

The ending of this movie also became like the ending of Wish, another movie I didn't like.

"Snow White is a beautiful retelling of a classic film. It has catchy music and amazing acting, while also presenting an incredibly creative story. An amazingly talented cast and gorgeous sets makes it feel truly magical.

Based on the 1937 classic Disney animated film, the story follows Snow White (Rachel Zegler), a princess who was hidden away by her stepmother, the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot), after her father left. After having enough of her stepmother, Snow White joins forces with seven dwarfs to bring her kingdom to peace once again while they help her take down the Evil Queen.

The songs in this film, composed by Jeff Morrow, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, are expertly crafted and catchy. Every song got stuck in my head until I heard the next one, and the incredible voice talent enhances them even more. My personal favorite has to be ""Whistle While you Work"" - Rachel Zegler's voice brings incredible energy and whimsy to the song, plus I love how the whistling is used in it. The sets and cinematography, directed by Mandy Walker, are also beautiful - the lighting stands out as it works perfectly and mixed with the magnificent sets creates a fantastic looking film. One shot I really love is when we first see the cottage in the forest. The costumes, designed by Sandy Powell, are also quite beautiful; however they don't all seem to go together. Each set of costumes feels like it was meant for a different time period, which feels a bit disconnected. I really like the Evil Queen's costumes; they're flawless and not only fit the kingdom, but also her character. The characters are really well scripted, and I love the actors for each of the key characters. I especially love Rachel Zegler's performance; the amount of emotion she shows brings so much life into her character and made me feel really sympathetic for her. This film had me enchanted the whole time through its story, songs and acting.

The film's message is to follow your morals and beliefs, even if it may not present easy decisions. Be warned that there are intense scenes and blood shown at some points.

I give Snow White 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to12. It releases in theaters March 21, 2025.

"Just got home after watching Snow White. Many of you are probably familiar with all the ridiculous drama surrounding the movie, and all of that just made me more curious about wanting to see it. I can admit that I was quite skeptical at first BUT I was actually very pleasantly surprised. It was almost the same as the original film from 1937 but with new scenes, new songs and new characters, and it actually worked. Rachel Zegler was a good fit for the role of Snow White. Gal Gadot as the Queen was a bit in between though it ranged from okay to terrible. The musical numbers were also well done, Pasek & Paul (who wrote the new songs) should get to write more Disney songs in the future Snow White's animal friends were incredibly cute and the 7 dwarfs were actually really funny, still a bit of an uncanny valley feeling about them but that disappeared quickly. The new character Jonathan (the prince's replacement) was quite okay and he had more character development than the prince in the original had.

"My family and I are Disney enthusiasts and do our best to remain optimistic in spite of critic bias before watching recent Disney releases.

Sadly, Disney has taken one of their most iconic animated films in Snow White and turned it into an unfortunate and borderline unforgivable, live remake.

There's a complete miss on the characters and their casting, an over saturation of CGI, and auto tuned songs spells the proverbial ""writing on the wall"" for the doom of the tragedy that is this film.

"This movie completely misses the mark by stripping away the character's signature softness and warmth. Rachel Zegler's Snow White comes across more frustrated than kind, often sounding angry rather than hopeful or gentle. While she has a strong voice, it doesn't fit the character, making her feel more like a rebellious heroine than the classic princess.

Gal Gadot's Evil Queen doesn't help either her performance feels stiff and uninspired, she sounded bored and it completely took away the charm.

"A complete failure on Disney's part. Setting aside the promo failures of Rachel and her PR team, this was probably one of the biggest losses Disney has suffered in recent memory. The movie felt as though the planning and writing were half baked and poorly executed.

"Disney's latest Snow White movie leaves behind a sense of disappointment, particularly for fans of the original 1937 animated film. The magical, Bavarian elements of the classic film, such as Snow White's traditional dirndl dress, the castle that resembles Neuschwanstein, the Black Forest setting, the Bavarian wood carvings in the dwarfs' cottage are all missing in the new adaptation. Even the Evil Queen's potion glass, a Bavarian wine glass in the original, was part of the charm that connected the film to its Southern German roots. The Yodel Song was also drastically shortened in the new film. This cultural richness contributed to the original's charm, and its absence makes the new version feel ""hollow.""

Gal Gadot has a strong presence in the film, but the brief and not-scary transformation scene of the Evil Queen was a letdown, as it was one of the standout moments in the animated film.

The reason I'm giving this a 2 instead of a 1 is that the new soundtrack is actually pretty catchy. Still, even though the new film has some redeeming qualities, it overall fails to capture the magic, atmosphere, and rich German cultural elements that made the 1937 movie so beloved.",2/10,disney latest snow white movie leaves behind sense disappointment particularly fans original animated film magical bavarian elements classic film snow white traditional dirndl dress castle resembles neuschwanstein black forest setting bavarian wood carvings dwarfs cottage missing new adaptation even evil queen potion glass bavarian wine glass original part charm connected film southern german roots yodel song also drastically shortened new film cultural richness contributed original charm absence makes new version feel hollow gal gadot strong presence film brief transformation scene evil queen letdown one standout moments animated film reason giving instead new soundtrack actually pretty catchy still even though new film redeeming qualities overall fails capture magic atmosphere rich german cultural elements made movie beloved,0.9191,0.217,0.115,0.668

"I can't believe I actually paid money to watch this film but my partner really wanted to see it and since she was graceful enough to come and watch John Wick 4 with me, I felt an obligation to even out the playing field.

What can I say about this? First off, the OG Snow White wasn't really my cup of tea but then, it wasn't aimed at people like me but I still appreciate what it represents and it's cultural significance.

I'm well aware of all of the controversy surrounding the film and it's 'star' but I tried to give a go and take it for what it is.

It's trash.

The effects are awful, everything looks like it's drenched in some kind of yellow filter and it gives you a headache after about half an hour. I don't need to mention the dwarves as they've been memed to death by this point, they're nightmare inducingly bad. Although I will admit, some of the CGI animals were kind of cute.

Some of the acting is woeful, especially from Gal Gadot who I genuinely like but she's horribly miscast here. I felt genuinely sorry for her.

The story feels like it's been cobbled together from multiple different scrips, it almost feels like several different films stitched together and it's jarring. Most of it feels off and weirdly incoherent.

Shockingly, the one aspect of the film I thought I'd hate the most (as I can not stand the woman) was Rachel Zegler, but I didn't. She's actually not bad in the role and one thing is sure, she can't half sing. She's probably the best thing in this turkey and that shocks me to say.

The songs (though well sung) are terrible, the music is typical Disney live action remake fluff, full of huge orchestral and over the top melodies that just make you cringe.

It's just a mess of a film that shouldn't have been remade. It's has very few redeeming qualities and I couldn't wait for it to end, oh and as for the ending, i won't spoil it but it's as anti climactic as it gets, I was genuinely shocked at how it wrapped up, I was like 'Really? Somebody wrote that and it passed through several script doctors and producers' Wait until you see it, it's laughable.

I hate this film, it's one of the worst cinema experiences I've had but I owed it to my partner. Who also hated the film lol It's one she's been waiting to see for ages and she was so upset at the end result, so I treated her to a nice French martini at a nearby bar to cheer her up, best part of the night :)

"This film is rather disturbing than charming. Many things have been said about this film. Walt Disney would be ashamed if he knew what they have made with this historical fairytale. Spoiler alarm: you will most likely be disappointed!

The magic and innocence of the original story are completely lost in this adaptation. Instead of a captivating fairy tale, we get a forced, modernized version that strips away the charm and depth of the classic. The characters feel hollow, the visuals lack the warmth and artistry of the original, and the storyline takes unnecessary liberties that add nothing of value.

It's as if the filmmakers were more interested in making a statement than in telling a compelling story. The emotional connection to Snow White and the dwarfs is missing, and the forced changes to the narrative feel more like an attempt to rewrite history rather than bring a beloved tale to life.

"I went into the new Snow White movie hoping for a fresh take on the classic fairy tale. Instead, I got a joyless, uninspired mess that seems to miss the point of the original entirely.

First, let's talk about the script-if you can call it that. The film is so obsessed with ""modernizing"" the story that it strips away everything that made Snow White charming in the first place. Instead of a timeless fairy tale about kindness and overcoming adversity, we get a bland, preachy slog filled with forced dialogue and a protagonist who is about as likable as a soggy piece of toast.

The visuals? Disappointing. For a movie with Disney's budget, I expected something magical. Instead, the CGI looks rushed, and the film's overall aesthetic feels more like a low-budget streaming release than a major theatrical event. Gone is the whimsical artistry that made the original animation so iconic.

The performances don't save it either. The lead actress delivers a flat, uninspired performance, seemingly more interested in lecturing the audience than bringing Snow White to life. And don't get me started on the dwarfs-or rather, the lack thereof. Their replacements feel like an afterthought, completely missing the charm and heart that made the original characters so beloved.

Disney's attempts to ""reimagine"" this classic have resulted in a film that has neither the heart of the original nor the creativity to stand on its own. It's a lifeless, soulless attempt at storytelling that alienates fans while failing to attract a new audience.

If you love Snow White, do yourself a favor and skip this. Just rewatch the 1937 classic-it's still leagues ahead of whatever this was supposed to be.",1/10,went new snow white movie hoping fresh take classic fairy tale instead got joyless uninspired mess seems miss point original entirely first let talk call film obsessed modernizing story strips away everything made snow white charming first place instead timeless fairy tale kindness overcoming adversity get bland preachy slog filled forced dialogue protagonist likable soggy piece toast visuals disappointing movie disney budget expected something magical instead cgi looks rushed film overall aesthetic feels like streaming release major theatrical event gone whimsical artistry made original animation iconic performances save either lead actress delivers flat uninspired performance seemingly interested lecturing audience bringing snow white life get started rather lack thereof replacements feel like afterthought completely missing charm heart made original characters beloved disney attempts reimagine classic resulted film neither heart original creativity stand lifeless soulless attempt storytelling alienates fans failing attract new audience love snow white favor skip rewatch still leagues ahead whatever supposed,0.9607,0.244,0.142,0.613
"This might just be the worst Disney live-action remake ever. The script is a total disaster-nothing makes sense, and it honestly feels like they were rewriting scenes on the spot without any real direction. The pacing is all over the place, the dialogue is cringey, and the whole thing feels like a rushed, half-baked mess.

Not a single moment in this Snow White feels engaging. It's not just that the lead actress seems totally miscast-the entire movie is filled with forced, unrealistic moments that completely pull you out of the story. Instead of creating something magical or meaningful, they shove in so many unnecessary changes and heavy-handed messaging that it's just exhausting to sit through. The balance between updating the story and keeping the heart of the original is completely off, making it feel more like a lecture than an actual movie.

Nothing flows naturally, and the lack of coherence makes it hard to care about anything happening on screen. The forced attempts to be modern feel incredibly awkward, and rather than feeling progressive or fresh, it just comes off as hollow and unnatural. It's hard to feel invested when everything feels like it was thrown together without much thought.

"I must confess, I did it-my daughter convinced me to watch Disney's new Snow White today. And yes, the rumors you've been hearing are indeed true. This adaptation of Snow White feels hollow, completely lacking in genuine magic or charm.

The dialogues come off as forced and unnatural, almost as if the writers weren't sure themselves where the story was supposed to go. Speaking of the story, it struggles to find clarity or coherence, stumbling aimlessly from one scene to the next without any real sense of direction or purpose. Most of Disney's recent remakes haven't lived up to their originals, and this one is no exception. It felt as if Disney wanted to launch something but had no clear idea what or in which direction to go.

Rachel Zegler, who portrays Snow White, spends the entire movie looking like she's genuinely surprised she landed the role-and not in a good way. Her performance feels disconnected, as if she's impersonating Snow White rather than truly embodying her.

"The film's lack of cohesive storytelling and its failure to capture the magical essence associated with Disney classics. Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is described as unconvincing, with her portrayal lacking depth and charm. While her singing ability is acknowledged, her character comes across as overly passive and inconsistent. The Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, is noted for her striking presence but is undermined by a script that fails to explore her motivations effectively.

Key plot points, such as Snow White's quest to find her father and the dynamics with the Seven Dwarfs, are riddled with inconsistencies and underdeveloped arcs. The narration by Dopey feels unnecessary and detracts from the story. Additionally, the film's tone awkwardly shifts between dark and whimsical, leaving viewers unsure of its intended audience.

"Disney Remake of it's own Snow White animation is misguided on it's attempt to completely revamp the core of the classic movie.

Even if we put the baggage that comes from that change aside, there's already other 'Snow White' adaptations that turned the eponymous character into a heroine in which Disney could take notes and lessons from.

Instead, this remake turns out to be the least charming and competent of them all.

"Disney's new Snow White is not just a swing and a miss-it's a complete betrayal of the timeless fairy tale that generations have cherished. At the center of the mess is Rachel Zegler, whose portrayal of Snow White is shockingly lifeless and condescending. Rather than honoring the role with grace and wonder, she seems more interested in mocking the original character than embodying her. Her performance is cold, smug, and drenched in modern cynicism. It's hard to tell if she even wanted to be in this film, and frankly, it shows.

Gone is the charm, the innocence, the magic. Zegler's Snow White is stripped of all the qualities that made the character iconic, replaced with a preachy, joyless figure who feels utterly out of place in a fairy tale. It's less a performance and more of a statement-and a poorly delivered one at that.

The only redeeming aspect of this disaster is Gal Gadot, who actually seems to understand the assignment. As the Evil Queen, she brings elegance, charisma, and a theatrical flair that's both entertaining and visually captivating. She outshines Zegler in every scene they share and feels like she belongs in a much better film.

"Disney's legacy was ruined with this cringeworthy feature.

They completely destroyed the essence of Snow White, turning a beloved classic into a lifeless, uninspired mess.

The dwarfs, once iconic and full of personality, are now bizarre CGI creatures that look like something out of a nightmare.

"Yes, the rumors you've been hearing are indeed true. This adaptation of Snow White feels hollow, completely lacking in genuine magic or charm.

The dialogues come off as forced and unnatural, almost as if the writers weren't sure themselves where the story was supposed to go. Speaking of the story, it struggles to find clarity or coherence, stumbling aimlessly from one scene to the next without any real sense of direction or purpose. Most of Disney's recent remakes haven't lived up to their originals, and this one is no exception. It felt as if Disney wanted to launch something but had no clear idea what or in which direction to go.

Rachel Zegler, who portrays Snow White, spends the entire movie looking like she's genuinely surprised she landed the role-and not in a good way. Her performance feels disconnected, as if she's impersonating Snow White rather than truly embodying her.

Unfortunately, the remake falls short of these standards. Moreover, the CGI dwarfs are just weird on so many levels and make the movie feel soulless. The film attempts to add magic, but ironically, it ends up losing the very magic and charm that made the original so beloved.

"Give a set of high school kids 500 dollars and they will build you a better set, definitely sing better, and most definitely write you a better screenplay.

I am a huge fan of the story of Snow White. From the books to the early animations it has always been a story that has captivated me. I was disappointed when I saw this will be adapted to a more modernized approach, but decided to look past that.

However, the CGI is so shockingly bad, I swear its unbelievably atrocious for effects in this day and age.

The only thing that overshadows the poor production and bad CGI, is the absolutely insanely bad acting. The lead actress is truly as bad as the negative hype surrounding her and should never have been paid a dime for her performance here. I really hope future producers see this slop from her and don't hire her for future releases.

In all, this movie for all it's many delays is lazy film making at it's best. Bad story, bad production value and really really bad acting.

"I can't even begin to express how infuriated I am after watching the latest adaptation of Snow White. This movie is an absolute travesty that fails on every level!

Instead of celebrating the traditional elements that made Snow White beloved for generations, the filmmakers decided to completely alter the character dynamics in an attempt to be ""progressive."" Newsflash: changing the essence of characters just for the sake of social commentary does NOT equal good storytelling!

Snow White herself feels more like a caricature than a character. She's portrayed as a rebellious teenager, full of angst, and completely dismisses the charm that made her story enchanting. The whimsical love story is reduced to a tired trope of ""I don't need a prince,"" diminishing the emotional core of the original tale. It's like they set out to remove every ounce of magic in favor of some misguided notion of empowerment.

And let's talk about the dwarfs. They've been re-imagined in a way that's not only ridiculous but also insulting. Instead of being endearing side characters, they come off as a jumbled mess of stereotypes with zero development. Their jokes fall flat, and it's clear that the writers were more focused on pseudo humor than crafting an engaging narrative.

The plot twists are not only predictable but also devoid of any real stakes. By the time we got to the climax, I found myself rolling my eyes rather than feeling any tension or excitement.

And the ending? Don't even get me started! It's a slap in the face to anyone who cherishes the original story.

"Ah yes, Snow White (2024)-a film that bravely asks, ""What if we took a timeless classic and made it aggressively unlikable?"" My personal favorite part? When Snow White girlbossed the dwarfs into doing chores for her. In the original, she lovingly said, ""And I will use the broom."" But in this one? Nope. It's ""And HE will use the broom."" Nothing says empowerment like delegating housework to a group of hardworking men who were minding their own business. Truly inspiring.

But wait-why stop at ruining the dwarfs when you can also add seven completely pointless bandits? That's right, we got dwarfs AND bandits, and yet somehow, the film had double the characters and half the charm. These bandits were about as necessary as a glass slipper at a marathon. Seriously, why were they there? What was their purpose? Did they get lost on their way to a Robin Hood audition?

I physically walked out of this movie. Not metaphorically, not emotionally-I stood up and left. And honestly? I think even the Prince wanted out.

Rachel Zegler: ""I don't need a Prince to save me."" The Prince: ""Good, because I'm actually here for your stepmother.""

And can we please stop pretending that bad writing is excusable because ""it's for kids""? Children deserve good movies, not whatever this was.

"I didn't walk into this film expecting much, but even with rock-bottom expectations, the new Snow White still managed to disappoint. It was awkward, joyless, and completely devoid of the heart and charm that made the original a classic.

The story was incoherent-scenes felt stitched together without any real flow, like they were just checking boxes off a badly written checklist. Snow White herself lacked personality, and the supporting characters were forgettable at best. The dwarves-or whatever they're calling them now-barely registered as characters. It felt like no one in the cast knew what kind of film they were supposed to be in.

Visually, it was dull. The sets looked like they came from a high-budget high school play, and the CGI somehow managed to feel both overused and cheap. And don't even get me started on the dialogue-it tried so hard to be modern and clever, but instead it came off as cringey and forced.

I couldn't finish it. I left early, which says a lot since I rarely ever walk out of movies.

"I rarely leave reviews, but this Snow White adaptation deserves a warning label. The plot was painfully boring, offering nothing fresh or engaging. It felt like the writers just went through the motions without any attempt to bring originality or emotional weight to the story.

Honestly, someone like Angelina Jolie would have brought the intensity and edge that could have saved this mess.

"Cuz this movie is chock full of it. Stinking, putrid, nauseating garbage.

Anytime a film is billed as ""reimagining"" a classic, that's new-speak code for ""made in a way that not only lacks charm, but goes the extra mile to offend people who enjoyed the original.

Based on the hype, I was expecting an urban, hip, updated version of the original, which was made back in the Middle Ages, when humans first learned to draw pictures. Instead it's a ""reimagined"" version that lacks any appeal. If the original version has a soul, this version is its lifeless, zombie-Frankenstein evil descendant.

"I just had the misfortune of witnessing the butchered remains of a beloved Disney classic, Snow White. The 2025 iteration, starring Rachael Zegler as the titular character, is an unmitigated disaster.

The film's troubled production history is well-documented, with numerous reshoots and last-minute changes that have resulted in a disjointed, tone-deaf mess. The CGI dwarfs, meant to be a technological marvel, come across as creepy and unconvincing. Real little people should have been cast for these roles. How far have you fallen, Disney? It's a shame, really, as the original's charm and character were deeply rooted in the memorable performances of the Seven Dwarfs.

But the real travesty here is Rachael Zegler's involvement. Her vocal disdain for the original story and its supposed ""problematic"" themes is not only misguided but also reeks of opportunism. It's clear that she's more interested in pushing her own agenda than in genuinely bringing this character to life. Her acting, as always, was extremely subpar and flat. Her only talent is that she's an above average singer.

The sole bright spot in this catastrophe is Gal Gadot, who brings a sense of gravitas and depth to her role as the Evil Queen. Her performance is a masterclass in nuance and subtlety, elevating the entire production with her presence. It's a shame that her talents are wasted in this otherwise forgettable film.

Snow White (2025) is a mess, a soulless reimagining that fails to capture the magic and wonder of the original. Even the most ardent Disney fans will find themselves checking their watches, waiting for the agony to end. Avoid this monstrosity at all costs.

"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Not the first 20min or so which is almost okay, but the rest is unintentionally hilarious. I have not laughed this much in a long time at a movie.

A couple of little less negative things are that the first part of the movie is almost watchable. Mainly because it is decently true to the original. Zegler is not as bad as I thought, she can actually sing. And... uh... well, that is pretty much it.

Ignoring the Dwarfs for sanity reasons: Around the 30min mark or so this movie takes a very weird turn. Suddenly we are introduced to a bunch of characters (not the Dwarfs...) that will forever go down in history as the worst ever portrait on film. And from meeting those empty shells of characters it is all downhill.

Although Zegler is surprisingly not completely awful for most of the film, the rest of the cast are all so bad they make The Acolyte acting look masterful in comparison. The prince, whom is not a prince at all, just a robber and thief, he kisses snow like she has the plague, and Gadot is just Gadot trying to be... I dunno, some parody of an evil queen I guess.

This is about 50% true to the original, but the things they changed are so out there and so hilariously unpleasant I could not contain my laughter. This is so inapt and so badly done I cannot understand why Disney didn't shelf it or postponed it for 2 years to remake the whole thing. Someone actually approved this for the theatre. Wow. Disney... what are you doing?

I give this a 2/10 because the first 20min was almost okay and because Zegler was not as horrible as I thought she would be. But make no mistake, this is one of the worst movies you will ever see.

"I watched Disney's new Snow White-and wow, what a trainwreck. If the goal was to drain every ounce of charm, whimsy, and storytelling from the original and replace it with awkward performances and out-of-touch messaging, then mission accomplished.

Let's talk about Rachel Zegler. Her portrayal of Snow White felt like she accidentally wandered in from a completely different movie... and didn't bother reading the script. I've seen more emotion and sincerity in high school drama class performances. And that's just on set. Off set, her interviews came off as arrogant and dismissive-almost like she resented the fact that the original even existed. You'd think someone starring in an iconic remake would at least pretend to care.

This wasn't a modern reimagining. It was a complete dismantling of a classic tale in favor of something painfully forced and joyless.

"I'm genuinely puzzled by the wave of negative reviews. As someone who recently revisited the original 'Snow White,' I found this adaptation to be a refreshing and compelling update, perfectly tailored for contemporary audiences.

"Disney's Snow White (2025) is proof that even when expectations are low, a movie can still find a way to disappoint.

From the start, there was plenty of skepticism about this remake, and unfortunately, the final product does nothing to change that. The film feels like it's trying so hard to be modern and different that it forgets what made the original special in the first place.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White feels forced and lifeless. The dwarfs-sorry, the ""magical outcasts""-are such a weird creative decision that they barely even feel like part of the story. Even Gal Gadot, who should've been an over-the-top, fun villain , is wasted on a bland and forgettable performance.

Visually, it's not much better. The CGI is inconsistent, the costumes feel cheap, and the whole thing lacks that classic Disney magic. The singing is properly the only thing that make it a bit more bearable.

"The much-anticipated (or perhaps dreaded, depending on your perspective) ""Snow White 2025"" has unfortunately landed with a thud, proving to be a significant misstep for the studio. While numerous factors contribute to its overall failure, the most glaring and ultimately damaging aspect is the casting and subsequent performance of Rachel Zegler in the titular role. Instead of a fresh and captivating take on a beloved classic, we are presented with a Snow White who feels miscast, lacking the essential charm and vulnerability that define the character, ultimately dragging the entire film down with her.

From the outset, Zegler's portrayal struggles to capture the inherent innocence and gentle spirit traditionally associated with Snow White. Her performance often comes across as assertive and even slightly defiant, qualities that clash jarringly with the character's established persona. While some might argue for a ""modern"" take on Snow White, the changes feel less like empowering updates and more like a fundamental misunderstanding of the character's core essence. The audience struggles to connect with a Snow White who doesn't radiate the kindness and inherent goodness that makes her plight so compelling.

Furthermore, Zegler's vocal performance, while undoubtedly technically proficient, lacks the ethereal quality and emotional depth needed for the iconic songs. The musical numbers, instead of soaring and enchanting, often feel strained and disconnected from the emotional narrative. This is a significant blow to a story so deeply rooted in its musical heritage. The magic that should emanate from Snow White's voice is simply absent, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and nostalgic for previous iterations.

Beyond the characterization and vocal delivery, Zegler's on-screen presence feels somewhat ill-suited to the fairytale setting. There's a disconnect between her contemporary energy and the fantastical world the film attempts to create. This is not to say that modern actors cannot inhabit period roles, but in this instance, the fit feels forced, preventing the audience from fully immersing themselves in the story.

It's difficult to ignore the sense that the casting was driven by factors other than finding the best fit for the role. While representation is undoubtedly important, prioritizing it over the fundamental qualities of the character has unfortunately resulted in a central performance that actively detracts from the film's potential. This isn't a criticism of Zegler as an individual, but rather a critique of a casting decision that ultimately sabotaged the film.

The weaknesses in Zegler's portrayal ripple outwards, negatively impacting other aspects of the movie. The dynamic between Snow White and the dwarves feels less heartwarming and more transactional, lacking the genuine affection that should be at its core. The Evil Queen's motivations, while perhaps explored with more nuance, lose some of their impact when juxtaposed with a Snow White who doesn't evoke the same level of empathy and protectiveness from the audience. Even the visual spectacle of the film feels somewhat hollow when the central character fails to resonate.

Ultimately, ""Snow White 2025"" falters significantly due to the miscasting and underwhelming performance of Rachel Zegler. While other elements of the film may have their flaws, her portrayal of Snow White lacks the essential charm, vulnerability, and vocal magic needed to bring this beloved fairytale to life. This failure to connect with the audience on a fundamental level makes it difficult to invest in the story, leaving ""Snow White 2025"" as a poisoned apple in the realm of cinematic adaptations, a cautionary tale of prioritizing casting agendas over the intrinsic needs of the character and the story itself. The film's failure will likely be attributed, in no small part, to the central performance that simply couldn't capture the enduring magic of Snow White.",1/10,perhaps dreaded depending perspective snow white unfortunately landed thud proving significant misstep studio numerous factors contribute overall failure glaring ultimately damaging aspect casting subsequent performance rachel zegler titular role instead fresh captivating take beloved classic presented snow white feels miscast lacking essential charm vulnerability define character ultimately dragging entire film outset zegler portrayal struggles capture inherent innocence gentle spirit traditionally associated snow white performance often comes across assertive even slightly defiant qualities clash jarringly character established persona might argue modern take snow white changes feel less like empowering updates like fundamental misunderstanding character core essence audience struggles connect snow white radiate kindness inherent goodness makes plight compelling furthermore zegler vocal performance undoubtedly technically proficient lacks ethereal quality emotional depth needed iconic songs musical numbers instead soaring enchanting often feel strained disconnected emotional narrative significant blow story deeply rooted musical heritage magic emanate snow white voice simply absent leaving audience feeling underwhelmed nostalgic previous iterations beyond characterization vocal delivery zegler presence feels somewhat fairytale setting disconnect contemporary energy fantastical world film attempts create say modern actors inhabit period roles instance fit feels forced preventing audience fully immersing story difficult ignore sense casting driven factors finding best fit role representation undoubtedly important prioritizing fundamental qualities character unfortunately resulted central performance actively detracts film potential criticism zegler individual rather critique casting decision ultimately sabotaged film weaknesses zegler portrayal ripple outwards negatively impacting aspects movie dynamic snow white dwarves feels less heartwarming transactional lacking genuine affection core evil queen motivations perhaps explored nuance lose impact juxtaposed snow white evoke level empathy protectiveness audience even visual spectacle film feels somewhat hollow central character fails resonate ultimately snow white falters significantly due miscasting underwhelming performance rachel zegler elements film may flaws portrayal snow white lacks essential charm vulnerability vocal magic needed bring beloved fairytale life failure connect audience fundamental level makes difficult invest story leaving snow white poisoned apple realm cinematic adaptations cautionary tale prioritizing casting agendas intrinsic needs character story film failure likely attributed small part central performance simply could capture enduring magic snow white,-0.4962,0.167,0.165,0.667
"Another poor remake with a B-grade cast trying desperately to make something of themselves. From the moment the film begins, it's apparent this is not the enchanting tale we all grew up loving. The magic, the charm, the warmth-none of it is present. Instead, what we're given is a hollow, uninspired reimagining that lacks soul, cohesion, and even basic cinematic appeal.

Let's start with the acting. At best, it's wooden; at worst, it's completely detached. The cast seems awkwardly thrown together, and not one performance manages to stand out in a meaningful way. The lead lacks the charisma and emotional depth to carry the weight of such an iconic character. There's no gravitas, no growth, and certainly no spark that would make her believable as the ""fairest of them all."" Supporting characters fare no better. Most feel like afterthoughts-poorly written and poorly portrayed. The chemistry between characters is non-existent, making it incredibly difficult to care about any of them or their fates.

The singing-another key component of any Disney musical-is underwhelming at best and jarring at worst. The original Snow White had unforgettable melodies that have endured for generations. In contrast, this remake offers forgettable and at times cringe-inducing musical numbers that feel shoehorned in rather than seamlessly woven into the narrative. Whether due to lackluster vocal performances, uninspired arrangements, or poor sound mixing, the musical moments consistently fall flat. Songs that should have elevated the emotion of a scene instead serve as distractions or unintentionally comedic breaks.

Visually, the film is also a disappointment. While Disney usually prides itself on delivering cinematic eye candy, this movie's CGI feels overdone and artificial. The enchanted forest lacks wonder, the animals lack personality, and the once-iconic imagery-like the Evil Queen's mirror or the dwarfs' cottage-feels generic and stripped of any visual identity. Even the costumes and set designs feel like low-budget approximations rather than thoughtfully crafted elements of a fantasy world.

Narratively, this remake tries too hard to be different and ends up losing the essence of what made the original beloved in the first place. In attempting to modernize the story, the filmmakers have abandoned the timeless qualities of love, kindness, and humility that defined Snow White. Instead, we're given a confused message that doesn't know whether it wants to be a fairy tale or a social commentary. It's possible to update a story for modern audiences while respecting its roots, but this film fails on both fronts. The pacing is also inconsistent-some scenes drag on with unnecessary dialogue, while others rush through important plot points with no emotional payoff.

Character development is sorely lacking. The Evil Queen, who should be a terrifying and iconic villain, comes off as flat and one-dimensional. Her motivations are murky, her presence barely menacing. Meanwhile, the dwarfs-once the heart and comic relief of the original-are reduced to mere caricatures, each lacking distinctive personalities or memorable moments.

It's also worth noting that the film's tone is all over the place. At times it feels like it's trying to be serious and grounded; at other times, it leans into goofy slapstick with no transition or consistency. This tonal confusion makes it hard to understand what kind of audience the film is even trying to appeal to.

All in all, this remake of Snow White is a misfire on almost every level. It lacks the magic, the heart, and the timeless charm that made the original a classic. Disney needs to seriously reconsider its strategy with these live-action adaptations. Nostalgia alone isn't enough. If they continue down this path-relying on mediocre casts, uninspired scripts, and tone-deaf storytelling-they'll continue to churn out flops that tarnish the legacy of their beloved animated originals.

Some catchy songs, sticks to the story with a few minor detours and she can really sing. The Queen might be a bit scary for younger children used to the original and the film overall has a more grown up feel.

"Disney should've learned from the completely abysmal live-action of The Lion King. Where the original animated version was full of life and emotion, the remake became nothing more than a nature documentary and a CGI. Playground. This film follows the same fate. The casting and acting was terrible. Both snow white and the queen lacked emotional range, and it felt like I was watching a table read of the script rather than an actual professional performance. The music is auto-tuned and stale, and fails to evoke emotion. The use of CGI for the dwarves (instead of actually casting smaller people) was cheesy and reminds you of a corny B-movie. I don't know how Marc Webb failed so miserably because Spiderman 1 and 500 Days were both amazing movies. Fun, funny, and the two romantic leads in those movies had crazy good chemistry. Like, really good. But he also did TASM2 and that was terrible. So, it's a hit and miss with him.

"The new Snow White movie is an absolute mess, and Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is a major contributor to its downfall. Rather than delivering a menacing, commanding performance, Gadot's portrayal feels forced, as if she's reading lines without any genuine connection to her character. It's as though she believes just looking stern is enough to convince us she's evil, but the flat delivery and lack of depth only make her seem more like a confused villain than the sinister figure we're meant to fear. Her presence, instead of elevating the film, actually drags it down, making you wonder how such a talented actress could fall so short in such a pivotal role.

The character design, the dialogue, and the interactions feel disconnected and shallow, and Gadot doesn't help by underplaying what could've been a campy, exaggerated portrayal. It's not just bad-it's boring. Watching her attempt to hold her own against Snow White is like watching paint dry. If the Evil Queen is supposed to be a complex and captivating character, she's anything but here. The film is a testament to missed opportunities, and unfortunately, Gal Gadot's performance stands as a prime example of that.",1/10,new snow white movie absolute mess gal gadot portrayal evil queen major contributor downfall rather delivering menacing commanding performance gadot portrayal feels forced reading lines without genuine connection character though believes looking stern enough convince us evil flat delivery lack depth make seem like confused villain sinister figure meant fear presence instead elevating film actually drags making wonder talented actress could fall short pivotal role character design dialogue interactions feel disconnected shallow gadot help underplaying could campy exaggerated portrayal boring watching attempt hold snow white like watching paint dry evil queen supposed complex captivating character anything film testament missed opportunities unfortunately gal gadot performance stands prime example,-0.9806,0.107,0.302,0.591

I actually thought it was fairly ok right before the dwarfs came on screen, right when Snow White traveled through the dark forest.

And that dress, my God, it doesn't work in the real world. Who dresses like that? Gal Gadot, don't let me get started.

"Disney's Snow White remake is a disaster, but nothing drags it down more than Gal Gadot's atrocious performance as the Evil Queen. Once again proving that no amount of expensive PR can make up for a complete lack of acting talent, Gadot delivers her lines with the same lifeless, wooden expression she's had in every role she's ever played. There is no menace, no depth, no presence-just a painfully awkward attempt at being a villain that falls flat in every scene. It's clear she was cast not for her ability to embody the role but for her name recognition, and the result is an embarrassing, cringe-inducing performance that makes even the worst Disney villains look masterful in comparison. Every moment she's on screen is a reminder that Hollywood's obsession with forcing unqualified actors into major roles is ruining films, and Snow White suffers the most from this mistake.",1/10,disney snow white remake disaster nothing drags gal gadot atrocious performance evil queen proving amount expensive pr make complete lack acting talent gadot delivers lines lifeless wooden expression every role ever played menace depth painfully awkward attempt villain falls flat every scene clear cast ability embody role name recognition result embarrassing performance makes even worst disney villains look masterful comparison every moment screen reminder hollywood obsession forcing unqualified actors major roles ruining films snow white suffers mistake,-0.9861,0.103,0.385,0.512
"Zegler's portrayal of Snow White feels completely disconnected from what the character represents. Instead of breathing life into the role with warmth, kindness, and grace, we get a version of Snow White that's cold, unrelatable, and at times even dismissive of the source material. Her off-screen comments didn't help, but the real disappointment is that her performance feels phoned in, lacking the sincerity needed to carry such an iconic film.

Visually, the movie tries too hard to be modern and in doing so, strips away the fairy tale magic. The script is clunky, the pacing is awkward, and the decision to move away from the classic story beats makes it feel like Snow White in name only.

"Boy never thought I'd have to say that about a Disney movie.

The only reason I'm writing a review is because I know there's going to be a ton a negativity here so trying to show the other side.

The beginning was a bit of a slog to get through; it was pretty sugary. Yes we know she had a wonderful family and everyone loved everyone else and then Mom died and Dad picked a terrible second wife. Blah blah blah But for all those rumors swirling about how Snow doesn't need a Prince apparently that didn't mean they weren't going to give us a male hero...in this iteration he's more or less a Robin Hood kind of guy. Kind of vanilla but it's a princess movie, right ?

The dwarves were a LOT to get past but you do actually get used to the weird CGI (not quite as creepy as the Polar Express) and they play their parts well enough.

Ludicrous that Disney used CGI for the Seven Dwarves and then in the next bit of the film there is an actual little person (can't say dwarf or Peter Dinklage will get mad🙄) who gets more character development than any of the Seven do.

Snow herself is very sweet but I can see for kids she would have her charm. The Evil Queen is a scenery chewing Gal Gadot, channeling her inner Joan Crawford in an interesting flip from her usual heroic roles. (be prepared --- she sings!! Very trashy and lots of fun) There's a lot of echoes from other films here, but as someone who has seen the original on the big screen (in a rerelease back in the 70s) and loved it for decades I can say this version is quite enjoyable. Was it necessary? No Is it vintage Disney? No Did it come out too close to Wicked? Yes!!!

Will you like it?

I don't know.

This was the movie that started it all, so I do wish it was BETTER . It's going to be in regular viewing rotation as soon as it hits Disney plus, so it's kind of nice to see it on the big screen.

"The 2025 adaptation of ""Snow White"" takes significant liberties with the classic fairy tale, resulting in a film that feels both disconnected and contrived. Rachel Zegler, cast in the titular role, emerges as a controversial choice, not merely for her distinct divergence from the traditional Snow White image, but more so due to her publicly voiced disinterest in the original film and character. This lack of affinity with her character's heritage is palpable, casting a shadow over her performance and making it difficult for audiences to connect with her portrayal of a beloved fairy tale figure.

Compounding the film's issues is the casting of Gal Gadot as the envious Queen, which strikes as particularly jarring. Gadot, undeniably charismatic, overshadows Zegler in scenes they share, which fundamentally contradicts the narrative's premise of overwhelming jealousy based on beauty. This casting misstep not only undermines the story's credibility but also disrupts the viewer's suspension of disbelief. The film thus struggles under the weight of its own casting paradox, resembling more a tale of ""the emperor's new clothes"" where the audience is expected to ignore the evident miscasting for fear of broaching sensitive topics.

Overall, Disney's attempt to modernize ""Snow White"" and imbue it with contemporary themes misfires, resulting in a film that neither honors its source material nor succeeds in crafting a compelling new vision. The film, rather than offering a fresh take on an old classic, comes off as an uninspired, muddled attempt that lacks both heart and coherence.",1/10,adaptation snow white takes significant liberties classic fairy tale resulting film feels disconnected contrived rachel zegler cast titular role emerges controversial choice merely distinct divergence traditional snow white image due publicly voiced disinterest original film character lack affinity character heritage palpable casting shadow performance making difficult audiences connect portrayal beloved fairy tale figure compounding film issues casting gal gadot envious queen strikes particularly jarring gadot undeniably charismatic overshadows zegler scenes share fundamentally contradicts narrative premise overwhelming jealousy based beauty casting misstep undermines story credibility also disrupts viewer suspension disbelief film thus struggles weight casting paradox resembling tale emperor new clothes audience expected ignore evident miscasting fear broaching sensitive topics overall disney attempt modernize snow white imbue contemporary themes misfires resulting film neither honors source material succeeds crafting compelling new vision film rather offering fresh take old classic comes uninspired muddled attempt lacks heart coherence,-0.3616,0.147,0.172,0.681

"I went into this movie hoping for a magical fairy tale, but instead, I got a budget cosplay convention with the charm of a wet sock. Snow White, the fairest of them all? More like the most unbothered of them all. I've seen more emotion from my Roomba when it gets stuck under the couch.

The dwarfs? Oh, sorry-the seven vaguely assembled individuals who may or may not be shorter than average. They had less chemistry than a high school dropout. The Evil Queen? I was low-key rooting for her. Prince Charming? He was so forgettable that I already forgot if he was even in the movie.

The CGI was so bad that I thought my screen had a virus. The dialogue? If you told me ChatGPT wrote it, I'd believe you. And the message of the movie? I think it was ""Don't expect too much from life, or from this movie.""

"Disney's 2025 Snow White is a baffling misfire-an uninspired, joyless attempt to modernize a classic that neither respects the original nor offers anything fresh. Despite boasting a talented cast and a massive budget, the film is a soulless spectacle weighed down by poor writing, awkward performances, and uninspired visuals. One of the film's biggest failures is its attempt to ""update"" Snow White by stripping away the very elements that made it a timeless fairy tale. Instead of a heartfelt story about kindness, resilience, and magic, we get a protagonist who lacks charm and a narrative that feels cobbled together from corporate boardroom decisions. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is more of a generic ""strong female lead"" archetype than a character with depth, and the script never gives her room to develop beyond that.",1/10,disney snow white baffling uninspired joyless attempt modernize classic neither respects original offers anything fresh despite boasting talented cast massive budget film soulless spectacle weighed poor writing awkward performances uninspired visuals one film biggest failures attempt update snow white stripping away elements made timeless fairy tale instead heartfelt story kindness resilience magic get protagonist lacks charm narrative feels cobbled together corporate boardroom decisions rachel zegler snow white generic strong female lead archetype character depth script never gives room develop beyond,-0.2561,0.147,0.177,0.676

"Disney's Snow White (2025) is a disappointing, unnecessary remake that strips away the charm of the original in favour of a bland, lifeless modernisation. While the film attempts to update the classic tale with a more ""empowered"" Snow White, the result feels forced, uninspired, and ultimately hollow.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is underwhelming. Rather than embodying the warmth and kindness that made the original character so beloved, she comes across as disengaged and unremarkable. Her line delivery lacks depth, making it difficult to connect with her version of the character. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen had potential, but the film fails to make her truly menacing or memorable. Instead, her performance is reduced to exaggerated expressions and weak writing.

Visually, the movie is a disaster. The CGI is particularly bad, especially when it comes to the seven dwarfs (or the awkward replacements for them). The overuse of digital effects makes everything feel artificial, lacking the organic magic of classic Disney animation or even previous live-action adaptations like Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast. Instead of feeling enchanted, I was distracted by how oddly animated and unrealistic everything looked.

The narrative itself is muddled. Disney clearly wanted to move away from the traditional fairy-tale romance, but in doing so, they created a story that lacks emotional depth. The attempts at modern empowerment feel like a checklist rather than meaningful character development. Snow White no longer dreams of love, but she also doesn't seem to have a compelling alternative goal. It's as if the film is more focused on rejecting the past than telling a strong new story.

Even the music fails to leave an impression. The new songs are forgettable, and the absence of iconic classics like Someday My Prince Will Come only makes the film feel more disconnected from its roots.

Overall, Snow White is a soulless cash grab, proving once again that not every classic needs a remake. Instead of adding something new, it takes away everything that made the original special.",1/10,disney snow white disappointing unnecessary remake strips away charm original favour bland lifeless modernisation film attempts update classic tale empowered snow white result feels forced uninspired ultimately hollow rachel zegler performance snow white underwhelming rather embodying warmth kindness made original character beloved comes across disengaged unremarkable line delivery lacks depth making difficult connect version character gal gadot evil queen potential film fails make truly menacing memorable instead performance reduced exaggerated expressions weak writing visually movie disaster cgi particularly bad especially comes seven dwarfs awkward replacements overuse digital effects makes everything feel artificial lacking organic magic classic disney animation even previous adaptations like cinderella beauty beast instead feeling enchanted distracted oddly animated unrealistic everything looked narrative muddled disney clearly wanted move away traditional romance created story lacks emotional depth attempts modern empowerment feel like checklist rather meaningful character development snow white longer dreams love also seem compelling alternative goal film focused rejecting past telling strong new story even music fails leave impression new songs forgettable absence iconic classics like someday prince come makes film feel disconnected roots overall snow white soulless cash grab proving every classic needs remake instead adding something new takes away everything made original special,0.9809,0.268,0.147,0.585
"Dear Lord.

This film is a soulless, joyless husk of what was once a beloved animated masterpiece. Stripped of all magic and wonder, this film trudges along with all the grace of a corporate spreadsheet-lifeless, uninspired, and designed solely to squeeze more money out of nostalgic audiences while completely disregarding what made the original special.

Let's start with the CGI dwarves, which are nothing short of an abomination. Instead of casting talented little-person actors to bring these iconic characters to life, Disney bowed to the ridiculous and hypocritical opinions of Peter Dinklage, who somehow decided that hiring little people for these roles (the same kinds of roles that have made him rich) is offensive. The result? Awful, weightless CGI creatures that look like they crawled out of a cutscene from a bad 2010s video game.

But of course, what did we expect? This is yet another of Disney's soulless cash grabs, in which they strip-mine their own classics and reduce them to uninspired, pandering disasters. Rather than creating new, compelling stories, they keep regurgitating beloved films, gutting them of heart and sincerity in the process.

And let's not even get started on how this film completely spits in the face of its audience. It takes a timeless fairy tale and mangles it into an ugly, modern, feminist lecture, force-feeding us a misguided and graceless revision of masculinity and femininity. Gone are the classic themes of love, virtue, and kindness, replaced by a clumsy, heavy-handed attempt at empowerment that lacks any charm or authenticity.

Finally, the casting is just laughable. We're seriously expected to believe that Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is jealous of the beauty of Rachel Zegler's Snow White? That's not just a stretch-it's outright comedy. It completely undermines one of the most fundamental aspects of the story. If the audience is too busy laughing at the absurdity of the premise, how are we supposed to be invested in the narrative?

At the end of the day, this film is just another example of Disney's creative bankruptcy. It disrespects its source material, alienates its audience, and fails in every way to justify its own existence.

"I usually try to find something redeemable in every film I watch, but with Snow White (2025), that task proved nearly impossible. This film is a complete misfire, both in terms of storytelling and execution, and honestly, I'm still wondering how it even got greenlit in its current form.

Let's start with the obvious: this is not Snow White. It's a hollow reimagining that strips away everything that made the original timeless. Gone is the heartwarming charm, the sense of wonder, and the emotional core. What we're left with is a preachy, politically charged narrative that seems more focused on pushing an agenda than telling a compelling story.

The lead performance lacks charisma and warmth. Snow White, once a symbol of kindness and innocence, is now cold, defiant, and unrelatable. While reinterpreting characters can work when done with care, here it feels forced and out of sync with the tone of the story. Supporting characters - including the dwarfs (sorry, ""magical companions"") - are either underdeveloped or completely unnecessary. The chemistry between characters is nonexistent, and many scenes drag without purpose.

Visually, the film is uninspired. The CGI looks cheap at times, and the costume design feels like it was ripped from a high school theater production. Even the forest - usually a place of magic and mystery - feels sterile and lifeless.

I'm all for updating classics and making them resonate with new generations, but it has to be done with respect and care. This version of Snow White feels like it was written by committee, afraid to commit to a clear vision and desperate to tick all the ""modernization"" boxes.

Disney has proven it can make successful live-action remakes (Cinderella, The Jungle Book), but this isn't one of them. It's not even close. If you're a fan of the original, I strongly advise skipping this one. It will only leave you frustrated, disappointed, and wondering why some stories can't just be left alone.",1/10,usually try find something redeemable every film watch snow white task proved nearly impossible film complete misfire terms storytelling execution honestly still wondering even got greenlit current form let start obvious snow white hollow reimagining strips away everything made original timeless gone heartwarming charm sense wonder emotional core left preachy politically charged narrative seems focused pushing agenda telling compelling story lead performance lacks charisma warmth snow white symbol kindness innocence cold defiant unrelatable reinterpreting characters work done care feels forced sync tone story supporting characters including dwarfs sorry magical companions either underdeveloped completely unnecessary chemistry characters nonexistent many scenes drag without purpose visually film uninspired cgi looks cheap times costume design feels like ripped high school theater production even forest usually place magic mystery feels sterile lifeless updating classics making resonate new generations done respect care version snow white feels like written committee afraid commit clear vision desperate tick modernization boxes disney proven make successful remakes cinderella jungle book one even close fan original strongly advise skipping one leave frustrated disappointed wondering stories ca left alone,0.9887,0.268,0.097,0.634
"I just watched the movie, and wow, I absolutely loved it. Maybe even the best live-action Disney film ever. It captured something truly magical-the kind of wonder and heart that made the original so special, while adding its own unique charm. The visuals were stunning, the performances were heartfelt, and the music was absolutely enchanting.

What frustrates me the most is that this film was torn apart before it even had a chance! People judged it before seeing it, without giving it the opportunity to shine. But it does shine-brightly! It's a film full of joy, adventure, and pure Disney magic.

This is a movie I wholeheartedly wish upon the world, and I hope that one day it will find a well-deserved place on Broadway. It has everything a great musical needs-memorable songs, lovable characters, and a story that touches the heart. The stage would be the perfect home for this incredible tale.

And let's talk about Dopey-he is, without a doubt, the star of the show! His charm, humor, and warmth stole every scene, and I couldn't help but fall in love with his character all over again.

If you're on the fence about watching this film, I urge you to give it a chance.

"Ah yes, Snow White (2025)-a film that bravely asks, ""What if we took a timeless classic and made it aggressively unlikable?"" My personal favorite part? When Snow White girlbossed the dwarfs into doing chores for her. In the original, she lovingly said, ""And I will use the broom."" But in this one? Nope. It's ""And HE will use the broom."" Nothing says empowerment like delegating housework to a group of hardworking men who were minding their own business. Truly inspiring.

But wait-why stop at ruining the dwarfs when you can also add seven completely pointless bandits? That's right, we got dwarfs AND bandits, and yet somehow, the film had double the characters and half the charm. These bandits were about as necessary as a glass slipper at a marathon. Seriously, why were they there? What was their purpose? Did they get lost on their way to a Robin Hood audition?

I physically walked out of this movie. Not metaphorically, not emotionally-I stood up and left. And honestly? I think even the Prince wanted out.

Rachel Zegler: ""I don't need a Prince to save me."" The Prince: ""Good, because I'm actually here for your stepmother.""

Bro really pulled a ""that's not my problem"" and dipped. Iconic.

And can we please stop pretending that bad writing is excusable because ""it's for kids""? Children deserve good movies, not whatever this was.

"I genuinely tried to watch Snow White objectively-open-minded, no nostalgia goggles, just a clean slate. And I was honestly shocked by how bad this movie was.

The pacing is awkward, the plot feels paper-thin, and the characters are so underdeveloped it's almost insulting. Snow White herself is less of a protagonist and more of a decorative object being moved around the story with zero agency. It's hard to root for someone who barely seems aware of what's happening around her.

The humor doesn't land, the dialogue is painfully simplistic, and the dwarfs-while iconic in name-are just cartoonish stereotypes with no real depth. I understand this was a product of its time, but that doesn't excuse how flat and dull everything feels. Even the villain, who should be a highlight, is reduced to melodramatic overacting and weak motivations.

Visually, it's dated-which is expected-but even so, the animation doesn't hold up in a way that compensates for the movie's many flaws. I wasn't expecting Pixar-level polish, but I was hoping for at least some sense of magic or charm. Instead, it felt like a chore to get through.

If this is considered a classic, it's only because of historical significance-not quality. Snow White is, unfortunately, a relic that hasn't aged well, and watching it today only highlights how far storytelling and animation have come.

"Like many other remakes, the question is why?

E.g. Why remake Mary Poppins, How to Train Your Dragon, Snow White, etc etc ?

Of course the reason is alway's money. A remake is an easy, low risk cash cow. (Or so Disney thought)

If they had stuck to the original story ,it could have been a success, with modern CGI and live action to recreate the classic.

Instead they decided to make changes, for no other reason, than because they could and that immediately jars (if you're fond of the original)

I digress

What's good about the film ?

Zegler can sing and does play the role competently .

Gal Gadot looks good (too good - see below)

Some of the music is nice.

What's not so good

Absurd when the mirror lies about who's the fairest of them, all. Gadot is miscast , they needed someone of Meryl Streep's age and acting ability for the roie.

Gadot lacks both acting and singing ability.

The film jumps about story wise (which ties in with having to re-edit after bad PR)

Where did the bandits come from ?

The Prince is really just a character who does pretty much nothing.

The Dwarves just looked weird and where are all the classic songs?

If this was the first time 'Snow White' was ever made , it would be 5/10, mediocre at best.

"Disney Snow White (2025):

A classic with a new touch of magic.

Great songs, enchanting images and beautifully acted and well cast roles.

Beautiful way of bringing Snow White to a new generation and as far as I'm concerned ready for transformation into a musical.

Yes, the story is different, the songs too (mostly), but I don't think that's a bad thing. There are many variations of this story made over time and (in my opinion) it keeps the experience interesting this way. The characters have more depth now and Dopey is so cute!

"It really wasn't that bad. The story was not that far from the original. The music was tolerable. It seemed inline with what I would expect from a live action Disney movie. I even enjoyed the dwarfs. I'm not sure why people disliked it so much.

I've always liked Gal Galdot. I'm not sure that she's a singer but it was a good effort. Rachel Zegler did a fine job The set and costumes were beautiful. I really liked the dwarfs' cottage and I liked the reinvention of the classic songs.

"Disney has officially lost the plot. This abomination of a film is not just bad-it's an insult to storytelling, filmmaking, and anyone who grew up loving the original Snow White. I sat through nearly two hours of this disaster, hoping it would redeem itself, but no. It only got worse.

"This movie is an absolute abomination. They butchered a classic! The acting is atrocious, the story is unrecognizable, and the whole thing is just... awful. A complete waste of time and money. Avoid at all costs! They should be ashamed. This isn't Snow White, it's a joke.

As someone who appreciates cinema in its various forms, I went into this new Snow White with an open mind, hoping for a fresh perspective or at least a competent execution of a familiar story. Unfortunately, this film is a profound disappointment on a technical and narrative level.

The direction lacks any discernible vision. The pacing is erratic, lurching from scene to scene without a clear sense of rhythm or purpose. The framing often feels amateurish, with compositions that lack visual interest or thematic resonance. There's a distinct lack of cinematic artistry on display.

The performances are uniformly uninspired. The lead actress, while perhaps given a specific direction, fails to convey any emotional depth or nuance. Her portrayal feels one-note and lacks the necessary complexity to carry the weight of the character. Supporting performances are equally flat and unmemorable.

From a narrative standpoint, the screenplay is a jumbled mess. The attempts at subverting expectations feel forced and lack the necessary groundwork to be truly impactful. The thematic explorations are shallow and underdeveloped, failing to offer any meaningful insights or fresh perspectives on the classic tale. The plot points feel contrived and the overall structure is disjointed.

The visual effects, while present, often feel unintegrated and distract from the storytelling rather than enhancing it. There's a lack of cohesion in the visual style, making the film feel disjointed and lacking a strong aesthetic identity.

Ultimately, this film fails not just as an adaptation, but as a piece of cinema in its own right. It lacks the fundamental elements of good filmmaking: compelling performances, a coherent narrative, and a strong visual language. It's a technically flawed and artistically bankrupt endeavor that offers little to engage or provoke thought. A truly missed opportunity to explore this timeless story with any genuine cinematic flair.

"In a stunning display of cinematic ineptitude, the 2025 remake of Snow White proves that not every classic fairy tale deserves a modern reimagining. This film is less a magical journey and more a painful exercise in how to completely butcher a beloved story.

The screenplay reads like it was written by a committee of disinterested marketing executives who once heard someone describe Snow White in passing. Our titular character, played with all the charisma of a department store mannequin, stumbles through a plot so convoluted that even the seven dwarfs would struggle to make sense of it.

The visual effects are a catastrophe that would make even low-budget YouTube creators cringe. The enchanted forest looks like it was constructed using a combination of stock footage and a toddler's finger paintings. The evil queen's transformation scenes are so poorly executed that they appear to have been rendered on a smartphone from 2010.

Dialogue reaches new heights of cringe-worthiness, with lines so wooden they could be used as lumber in home construction. Characters deliver exposition with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. Every potentially interesting moment is crushed under the weight of unnecessary plot twists and painfully forced attempts at ""modernizing"" the classic tale.

The musical numbers - if one can even call them that - sound like they were composed during a particularly uninspired karaoke night. Auto-tune is weaponized to such an extent that it becomes a form of auditory assault.

Perhaps the most offensive aspect of this film is how it manages to strip away every ounce of magic from a story that has enchanted generations. This isn't a reimagining; it's a total dismemberment of a classic fairy tale.

The main cast: I think Rachel Ziegler is very talented, she can act and she can sing, but she definitely was miscasted for this role, she looks like a parody, talent is not enough when you are forcing into character.

"Once upon a time, Disney was the keeper of dreams-the studio that brought fairy tales to life with magic, wonder, and heart. But they shattered one of their most cherished legacies. Snow White is not a reimagining; it is a betrayal.

This is not Snow White. Not even close. They have taken a story that has enchanted generations and ripped its soul apart. The timeless tale of beauty, kindness, and resilience against evil has been twisted into something unrecognizable.

The heart of the legend-the very essence of what made Snow White endure for over a century-is missing. And what remains is an empty shell, a film that wears the name Snow White but has nothing of her spirit.

What made Snow White special? It wasn't just the poisoned apple, the Evil Queen, or the seven dwarfs. It was the fairytale magic. It was the ''pure-hearted girl who won hearts through her kindness'', not arrogance. It was the contrast between innocence and vanity, between good and evil. But this film has no reverence for its own source material.

Instead, it tears apart its own foundation, rewriting history and distorting what made Snow White an icon in the first place.

They didn't adapt Snow White - they erased her. The filmmakers didn't care about preserving the legend. They cared about turning it into something else entirely and slapping the name ''Snow White'' on it. If they wanted to tell a different story, fine-then call it something else! But don't take a beloved classic and distort it beyond recognition.

The Evil Queen is supposed to be ''terrifying''. A chilling embodiment of vanity, envy, and obsession. But here? Stripped of her operatic grandeur, reduced to something utterly forgettable. Where is the ''menace''? Where is the deliciously dark presence that made the original Queen one of Disney's greatest villains?

And the seven dwarfs? Well, if you've seen the discussions, you already know how that went.

This is what stings the most: Snow White is a foundational story. It was the film that made Disney what it is today - the very first animated feature, a cinematic revolution, a legacy passed down through generations. To discard that history so carelessly, to treat it as if it needs fixing when it was never broken to begin with... it's heartbreaking.

Disney has always reinvented fairy tales, but they've never erased their souls before.

This time, they have. They have taken one of their most sacred stories and destroyed its identity.

You want to make a new fantasy film? Great. You want a new heroine, a new world, a new take? Go for it. But don't pretend this is Snow White when it clearly isn't.

Call it ''The Forest Princess''. Call it ''The Magic Mirror''. Call it literally anything else. But don't call it ''Snow White'' - because this isn't her story.

This is not magic.

This is not wonder.

"We took my niece and nephew to see it this afternoon. It wasn't on my radar, but the kids who are 6 and 7 wanted to go. I saw the original probably 59 years ago but remembered it as being a fun story with a sweet ending. This was anything but.... The kids who normally sit mesmerized watching Disney movies were pretty disinterested after about 3 or 4 minutes and we had to keep trying to get them to stop chatting and watch the movie. After giving up on that, we just watched it with the kids perking up during the singing numbers, and then they went back to chatting. I have to say that this was a pretty bad movie overall. By the end of the movie it left us not caring about any of the characters, the story was just pointless and terrible, and the CGI characters were more like monsters to the kids than dwarfs. The magical creatures people were talking about in line were also pointless. Gal did the best with the wooden lines she was given, and Snow White was just a weird character herself.

"One of the most loved and revered movies being remade with integral parts destroyed in the narrative because the writer/diector and actors do not understand what it stood for and the story behind it.

Snow White is a story of the victory of good vs Evil, of love and virtue... not ego 'winning' evil, breaking of family for the power of self (which is no power at all but a severe social disability).

I truly hope it is a major flop but I guess there are enough people curious and enough indoctrination of the youth through marketing to make it profitable.despite the drivel it is.

It is such a disaster in not reading the room that they had to redo the dwarfs because they in their infinite madness thought it was rude to cast dwarfs in a movie called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (not Snow White and the Seven Samurai which is another story completely written by Tom Holt and not Grimm).

"Rachel Zegler is obnoxious and gal gadot is a genocidal psychopath.

Where do I even begin with Snow White (2025)? This film is a perfect storm of everything wrong with modern Hollywood: tone-deaf casting, insufferable performances, and a story so mangled it makes the original fairy tale seem like Shakespeare.

Let's start with Rachel Zegler as Snow White. Her portrayal is nothing short of obnoxious. Instead of the graceful, kind-hearted princess we all know, Zegler delivers a smug, self-righteous performance that makes you root for the Evil Queen. Her line delivery is grating, and her attempts at humor fall flatter than a pancake. It's clear she's trying way too hard to be ""relatable"" and ""modern,"" but it just comes off as cringe-worthy.

And then there's Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. If Zegler is obnoxious, Gadot is downright unwatchable. Her performance is so wooden and lifeless, it's like she's reading her lines off a cue card for the first time. The character is supposed to be menacing and cunning, but Gadot's portrayal is more like a bored Instagram influencer trying to act evil. It's laughable, but not in a good way.

The script is a disaster. Instead of embracing the timeless charm of the original story, the writers decided to inject it with a heavy-handed political agenda that feels forced and unnecessary. The dialogue is clunky, the pacing is all over the place, and the attempts at ""modernizing"" the story are so ham-fisted, they'll leave you rolling your eyes.

The visuals are equally disappointing. The CGI is so overdone it looks like a video game cutscene from 2010. The dwarfs, who are now inexplicably replaced by a group of ""magical creatures,"" are forgettable and uninspired. The film tries to be visually stunning, but it ends up looking like a cheap knockoff of *Into the Woods*.

In short, *Snow White (2025)* is a dumpster fire of a movie. It's a perfect example of how not to adapt a classic fairy tale. Rachel Zegler's obnoxious performance and Gal Gadot's lifeless acting are just the tip of the iceberg.

"This new take on the classic German fairy tale by the house of mouse is truly a 'Graus' - which means ghastliness / horror / abomination in German. See what I did there?

Joking aside, we all knew from the trailer and word of mouth that this was going to be bad. But even bad movies can be enjoyed if they're just incompetent enough to be unintentionally entertaining.

Unfortunately, Snow White is'nt so-bad-it's-good either, because it lacks ambition. It doesn't aim high and miss, it aims... nowhere.

Snow White is a poster child for the common complaint from cinephiles about how ugly modern digital movies look. It's not hard to see why. Everything is shot in front of a blue screen. When you watch older movies, even failed fantasy efforts like Willow, they still look beautiful. There are shadows, contrasts, scene composition. Snow White, like many modern Disney films, looks dark and muddy. The characters hardly stand out from the background, there are no hard shadows, no bright highlights. Scenes shot in sunlight look darker than my living room.

Why is that?

Well if you compose your scene digitally, you limit yourself if you shoot your actors with hard shadows. So they shoot everything flat. And then add it into a flat scene.

The result being, that everything looks flat, boring and uncinematic.

In addition, the pacing is uneven. Kids will be bored to tears by the slow pace and lack of action and of course the socialist lectures.

People joked about this film being a DEI fest, but it's even worse than imagined. Snow White is no longer a princess, she's a feminist anti-patriarchal social justice warrior pushing for equity - through apple pies.

No, I'm not joking. More than half the movie is her giving social justice lectures about pies which amount to ""those who have more should share"". That's it, that's the message.

Rachel Zegler lacks charisma and charm, but has a decent singing voice.

Gal Gadot absolutely hams it up and is cartoonishly evil in all her scenes. While I never saw her as a great actress, every now and then she delivers a surprisingly good performance, similar to the first Wonder Woman movie. She's hits the perfect tone, and is fun to watch. Maybe it's because she is the only actor who's performance doesn't fall under bland.

Unfortunately, it's not enough to enjoy the movie.

This is by far the worst of the terrible Disney live action remakes.

"My honest thoughts on Snow White and just to clarify, Disney hasn't paid me to write something nice.

Disney's live-action remake of Snow White has been one of the most talked-about-and often unjustly maligned-films online. Despite the polarised critics and the relentless hate campaign, I firmly believe this film is pure Disney magic.

What truly stood out was how the story was adjusted for a slightly modern take. The film not only answers lingering questions about Snow White's skin color and the origin of her name but does so with a refreshing narrative twist that feels both authentic and engaging.

Rachel Zegglar delivers a brilliant performance that perfectly captures the quintessential Disney voice. She brings a captivating charm to the role, embodying the magic and wonder that the character deserves.

One of the main concerns leading up to the film was the CGI portrayal of the dwarfs. I was pleasantly surprised-these digital characters were executed flawlessly, preserving the charm of their animated counterparts. Their scenes in the diamond mine, in particular, looked stunning on screen, and I couldn't imagine them being any better served by human actors.

The musical numbers hit many high notes as well. I loved the classic ""Hi Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work,"" and the new song ""Wishing on a Wish"" was nicely done. While not every song hit the mark, the soundtrack overall enriched the fairytale atmosphere of the film.

Gal Gadot's performance, while occasionally a bit over-the-top, ultimately worked well-especially in her portrayal of the old witch with the poison apple. Even though some moments felt slightly exaggerated, her energy added an interesting dynamic to the film.

Compared to other live-action remakes like Wicked, which certainly had its moments, this version of Snow White stands out as my favorite Disney live-action adaptation so far. It exudes a pure fairytale feel that pays homage to the original animation while embracing a modern sensibility. The film might not have the grand scale of Wicked, but its charm, humor, and heart make it a delightful experience. The kids in the cinema laughed at key moments and all seemed be saying they enjoyed it leaving the cinema. My grandson, Charlie, loved it.

I wholeheartedly recommend taking your kids to see it. They'll love it, and so will you.

""Snowwhite"" is an absolute triumph of cinematic chaos. The plot is like a bad dream you can't wake up from-except you wish you could. The acting?

Zegler was decent and her singing was one of the only bright spots in the film, but Gadot gave one of the worst villain performances I have ever seen and probably the worst I have seen from her which is saying a lot considering she's a bad actress.

"This is just another Disney gamble that did not pay off. The difference, though, is that this abysmal film cost a quarter of a billion dollars.

That's right. $250,000,000.00.

And with that chunk of change, you get a low-rent cast that shouldn't be portraying the characters that they have been given, and CGI that reminds you that real dwarfs are necessary if one is to remake a live-action film about Snow White.

You can't really blame Disney on their decision to go through with the film, though. Even with the warning from the general public, they had already invested enough money into the project that they went ahead with it, hoping to get some return on their investment and a write off on their losses when tax time came around.

Of course, no one could predict the buffoonery of Rachel Zegler.

As we all know, Zegler was a PR nightmare. This needs to be address, even if it is a film review, since Zegler's personality carries onto the film itself.

Gal Gadot does not help matters either, since she plays the evil queen with the same vigor as a high school student. Frankly, it seems that she has never fully recover from the blunt reality check that her ""Imagine"" video gave.

The film itself is uninspiring. Sure, the visuals have been updated since the animated feature from 1937, but it does nothing for the story. In fact, the updated visuals take away from the innocence of the story, since every thing looks completely fake. Snow White does not look beautiful and innocent, but resembles a stock player at a parade event. The Evil Queen is not frightening, but instead almost looks comical. Cassandra Peterson would have done a better job as the Evil Queen.

Rachel Zegler gives an uninspiring performance as Snow White. She can sing, this cannot be argued, but her acting chops resemble a high school performance. At least Gal Gadot attempts to act, be it overacting. What is a bit humorous was with all the proclamations by Zegler that this ""Snow White"" was not a love story (by a ""stalker"") by a story of a woman empowered to be the leader that she is destined to be, the audience ultimately finds out that it is just a hollowed-out remake of the love story. In this film, Snow White is cared for by the Seven CGIs, and when she is put into her apple-coma, she is brought back to live by her love interest (who happens to be a thief, and not a prince....go figure). It is hypocrisy at its finest.

As far as the music is concerned, all songs sound nice, but they all are forgettable. You will not be humming ""Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, its off to work we go"".

The CGI little ones are nightmare fuel, and the rest of the CGI effect (like the forest animals) look just as bad. There is nothing cute to look at. I can honestly see young children being frighten by these dwarfs. I can imagine CGI Dopey looking up at some kid and saying, ""Oh, yes. They float.... They float....and when you're down here with me.... YOU'LL FLOAT TOO!""

I saw this film mistake with my niece and nephew. I knew it was not going to be a pleasant two hours, and Disney did not disappoint. When my niece and nephew saw ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971), for days they sang ""I've got a Golden Ticket...."". After seeing ""Snow White"", they went back to playing on their Xbox. Now that is as honest as a critique can be.

If you want your kids to see ""Snow White"", rent or buy the animated 1937 film. The innocence is still there, and perhaps your kids will learn that if you are good, then good things will happen to you. Perhaps a naive concept, but you have to give children all the hope you can.

""Snow White"" (2025) does not give anyone any hope.

"Do you know how much money we spent to take the family here with tickets and popcorn and drinks? $96. And do you know what the kids said? ""This isn't Snow White.""

We all sat down and watched the original and it's a good movie that tells the story of innocence, love, acceptance, and caring. This remake could have spent some more time paying attention to those themes. Disney could have spent some more time paying attention to what makes their classic movies classics. Movies my grandparents still watched in their old age and movies my 4 year old still sits and watches today.

This isn't a classic and isn't even going to get rewatches. What are they doing at Disney? All these hundreds of millions spent for soullessness. How does old animation beat real modern actors? That's a massive question they need to ask themselves and do it fast.

Gal Gadot was perfect. She nailed the part. Andrew Burnap should have been the prince. That is all.

Lord of the Rings nailed dwarves. This movie had hot CGI garbage as dwarves. It was horrifying. Keep these travesties away from the mine cart ride or they're going to ruin that as well.

A good movie has a cast and crew and writers and producers who all deeply care about the material. This movie CLEARLY did not. It was not a complete and total buy in and turned into a massive waste of money for the studio and anyone whose kids ask to see it only to hate it.

"Disney's live-action remake, Snow White (2025), veers away from the original magic of Walt Disney's Snow White and the original tale. I was open to the reimagining of this classic movie but unfortunately, it fails to deliver. From lackluster performances to miscasting key roles, this film misses with audiences (at least my showing tonight).

We can all agree that Rachel Zegler who takes on the classic tale of Snow White, delivers a performance that feels stilted and unimaginative. Her acting lacks the warmth and charisma that made the original animated Snow Whitesuch a hit.

For a film with a $260 million dollar production budget, the CGI looks fake and the CGI creatures lack the expressions, warmth, and charm of the original characters.

The dwarfs have been controversially reimagined look evil and creepy.

"First, I am not sure why Disney can't make more original movies instead of the endless remakes. It shows where we are at today, totally devoid of any creativeness.

I wanted to give everyone the compare the actual original story of Snow White. Especially the ending.

In the Grimm's book, the queen made one apple, but it was only PARTIALLY poisoned, the red side, the white side was fine and the queen offered Snow White the red side while eating herself the white side. When Snow White died, the Queen went back to the castle and asked the ""Looking-glass against the wall, Who is fairest of us all?"" at last it answered, ""You are the fairest now of all.""

After the dwarfs found Snow White dead they made a glass coffin for her and sat her on the mountain hill where one day the Prince rode by and offered to by her, but they first refused, until he promised to take care of her and them so the finally agreed to bring the coffin to the Castle, but on the way ""they stumbled over a bush, and with the shaking the bit of poisoned apple flew out of her throat. It was not long before she opened her eyes, threw up the cover of the coffin, and sat up, alive and well.""

While the prince and Snow White got married the Queen asked the looking-glass answered, ""O Queen, although you are of beauty rare, The young bride is a thousand times more fair."" The queen railed and cursed, and was beside herself with disappointment and anger. The queen felt she should have ""no peace until she went and saw the bride. And when she saw her she knew her for Snow-white, and could not stir from the place for anger and terror. For they had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance until she fell down dead.""

So the queen didn't die until AFTER the wedding. Back to this new monstrosity version.

The cast was totally miscast, from Gal being way too beautiful compared to Rachel playing Snow White. It was almost laughable the stark contrast it was. The whole point of the original Snow White is the Queen was jealous of Snow White's beauty.

The original Snow White, she was a kind, selfless person that enjoyed cleaning for the 7 dwarfs, but the new one she went straight to sleep. Is cleaning and cooking that offensive these days?

Then, the atrocious looking CGI garden gnomes of the 7 dwarfs, cause apparently it was offensive to hire actual dwarfs. This is PC running amok. And unlike the original Disney characters who were distinctly different, here they all kinda looked the same.

And a lot of the important, cute exposition form the original is missing, like when Snow White comments on the names of the dwarfs after she cleans, the new one she just goes to sleep right away, like she is entitled to sleep there, compared to the original where she verbalized that IF she cleaned their place they may let her stay, in there words, she wanted to do a good deed in hopes of getting something in exchange.

The prince wasn't even a prince, he was just some thief and no real good reason why she fell for him, he was kinda annoying. That whole bandit story was utterly pointless and the ending was atrociously embarrassing.",1/10,first sure disney ca make original movies instead endless remakes shows today totally devoid creativeness wanted give everyone compare actual original story snow white especially ending grimm book queen made one apple partially poisoned red side white side fine queen offered snow white red side eating white side snow white died queen went back castle asked wall fairest us last answered fairest dwarfs found snow white dead made glass coffin sat mountain hill one day prince rode offered first refused promised take care finally agreed bring coffin castle way stumbled bush shaking bit poisoned apple flew throat long opened eyes threw cover coffin sat alive well prince snow white got married queen asked answered queen although beauty rare young bride thousand times fair queen railed cursed beside disappointment anger queen felt peace went saw bride saw knew could stir place anger terror ready iron shoes dance fell dead queen die wedding back new monstrosity version cast totally miscast gal way beautiful compared rachel playing snow white almost laughable stark contrast whole point original snow white queen jealous snow white beauty original snow white kind selfless person enjoyed cleaning dwarfs new one went straight sleep cleaning cooking offensive days atrocious looking cgi garden gnomes dwarfs cause apparently offensive hire actual dwarfs pc running amok unlike original disney characters distinctly different kinda looked lot important cute exposition form original missing like snow white comments names dwarfs cleans new one goes sleep right away like entitled sleep compared original verbalized cleaned place may let stay words wanted good deed hopes getting something exchange prince even prince thief real good reason fell kinda annoying whole bandit story utterly pointless ending atrociously embarrassing,0.9518,0.232,0.164,0.604
I decided to take my kids with me seeing as it's a Disney movie and they love it. I wasn't sure if they or I would like because of the hate going around. I've grew up in the 90s with all original classics so this was big for me. I took a chance and went with it since my kids wanted me to go see with them. I kid you not during the first 30 minutes my kids wanted to leave. And mind you they are 7 to 12 years old. I find the messages there a bit to raunchy for kids movie. And not much action just talking throughout the first 30 mins. I got them to go with my wife I finished the movie and probably I would say the worst movie of Disney I've ever seen. The music choice was overbearing. The visuals were phenomenon but doesn't match with what's going on. It fell flat around the hour. Got some good moments and laughs but that's it.

My only critiques are that the pacing and storyline felt clunky at times toward the beginning/middle, and Gal Gadot fell flat..especially compared to the original and other variations-and I really hope she never sings on camera again.

Without spoiling too much (you will spoil your day watching this but still...) the movie is extremely dull, bland and poorly executed making you wonder why you even gave it a shot.

Also the fact that they decided to go with so much CGI for the dwarfs and forest shows to me how inpersonal and lazy they have been with the huge amounts of money they have for making movies nowadays into consideration, feeling like your watching a movie playout in a themepark.

Snow White, once kind and charming, is now a bland, lifeless character. The dwarfs? Gone, replaced by forgettable sidekicks. Not to mention, Gal Gadot acting as the Evil Queen is a trainwreck. The CGI is hollow, and the songs are forgettable. The movie forgets the magic of the original story, replacing it with preachy nonsense. I left feeling robbed. This version is proof that not everything needs a live-action remake. Thanks Disney for butchering my childhood.

Great casting. New songs beautifully done. Great special effects. Loved it. I enjoyed the updated twists to the old classic. Only I wish Gal Gadot wasn't so evil even if she was cast as the evil queen. Hope to see more Disney movies that I can take my kids too. Also more Disney for adults. Thanks for a diversity in your policies. Keep your stand Disney. We love what you do. So I have not enough words to submit this? I don't want to enter any spoilers so all I can do is reiterate the facts that the music and singing was top notch.

"I wish one day disney decides to do a Snow white movie the RIGHT way.. and do Lana Parrilla as the Evil Queen and Jenna Ortega as Snow White

now that would be truly epic.

As for this movie.

I know this review will get thumbs down .. but hey it's fine with me i'm not rolling with the hate train, half the people putting reviews here didn't even watched the movie and just go with the hate train.

Is this movie a 10\10 ? No... it's flat. The acting is flat, the cgi dwarfs are wierd, it's borig at times, and it's not as good as it could have been .

Is it a 1/10 movie ? Absulotely not.

Rachel has good stuff and bad stuff to her bad: -she is a not a good person OUTSIDE of the camera, she bad mouth Gal, the movie, and disney which effects how much you can love her as snow white -her acting is flat good: -she has a great voice -i personaly think she looks good, i know many think she's ugly but i dont see it i think she looks great.

-she is decent actor. Not good but decent.

Gal also has bad and good to her bad: -she cannot sing, her songs were autotune a lot.

-her acting is very flat as the evil queen it's not her best role.

Good: -she is drop dead beautiful -again her acting is decent it's not bad.

Yea they could do a lot more with Lana Parila (the one that playd the evil queen in once upon a time) and with Jenna Ortega (wensday from the adams family 'wensday' series on netflix) as snow white.

They could add some comedy to the evil queen not kept it so boring

add some nice creativity to the story, scenes, songs, have better director for the songs

they could have talked to the fans..... disney never talks to the fans..

they could have made this a 12/10 movie instead they made this

which is not bad it's def not a 1/10 movie

but it's a great 6/10 movie and you know what ?

I saw a little girl 5yo dressed as snow white in the cinema... yesterday she had the TIIME OF HER LIFE

for her she didn't care about Rachel outside the screens... for her.. it was just a magical movie about a princess.

That little girl would never see the 1937 original movie otherwise

"I took my kids to see the new Snow White movie over the weekend, expecting a magical experience since they absolutely adore the original. What a letdown. From the moment it started, it was clear this wasn't the charming tale we knew and loved. The characters felt flat, the story was a convoluted mess, and the songs-oh, the songs-were forgettable at best. My kids, who usually sit through anything with wide-eyed wonder, were fidgeting and whispering about how much they hated it. By the end, they were in tears-not from some emotional climax, but from sheer disappointment at how bad it was. I felt terrible for hyping it up.

"Disney's Snow White is a complete disappointment, failing both as a remake and as a standalone film. Instead of honoring the original 1937 classic, the movie strips away its heart and charm, replacing it with bland storytelling, uninspired performances, and baffling creative choices.

The film's biggest flaw is its lack of respect for the source material. Gone is the timeless fairy tale magic, replaced with a forced and preachy narrative that feels more like a checklist of modern studio mandates than a genuine attempt to tell a great story. The absence of the iconic dwarfs-one of the most beloved parts of the original-only makes things worse, as their replacements add nothing memorable.

Most likely Disney's worst remake yet.. honestly, not surprised.",1/10,disney snow white complete disappointment failing remake standalone film instead honoring original classic movie strips away heart charm replacing bland storytelling uninspired performances baffling creative choices film biggest flaw lack respect source material gone timeless fairy tale magic replaced forced preachy narrative feels like checklist modern studio mandates genuine attempt tell great story absence iconic beloved parts makes things worse replacements add nothing memorable likely disney worst remake yet honestly surprised,0.8402,0.282,0.185,0.533

"A princess joins forces with seven dwarfs to liberate her kingdom from her cruel stepmother the Evil Queen. A live-action adaptation of the 1937 Disney animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".

I wanted to give this a chance mostly because I love Gal Gadot. But, if you have a live action film, you can't colour it as if it was a cartoon. That's a hybrid film and has proven not to work, and it doesn't work here.

Also, they aren't dwarves. I don't know what they are but they aren't dwarfs.

Emilia Faucher who plays the young Snow White put in the best performance of any of the cast. That fact is shameful.

The magic mirror's voice, is that from the 60's?

And Gal Gadot has acted much better in the past. I don't know whether it was stresses with Zegler or simply a poor director but Gal was definitely not on form in this film.

And Zegler...well...she is literally playing a person who wants to impress on the screen. She's not playing a part of Snow White, she is very clearly trying to play anyway she can that she thinks will make her look good on screen. We've all seen it before but not in one so young. Also, just a quick reminder from the story of Snow White, ""Soon after that, the kind queen got her wish when she gave birth to a baby girl who had skin white as snow, lips red as blood, and hair black as ebony. They named the baby princess Snow White, but sadly, the queen died after giving birth to Snow White."" Now the American born and raised Zegler states that she identifies as latino due to some Colombian ancestor, and the fact that she clearly is not white in colour or culture. She is a DEI hire and we all know it, and we all dislike it because it shames the original story.

That said, I tried to be objective about the film and no matter what you think of any of the people in their personal lives, the film is a poor remake, and takes the shine from the original because of it. Disney have dropped the ball on this one as they knew it was coming, and they should have cancelled the film and taken the hit.

"Disney's live-action Snow White remake is a misguided attempt at modernizing a classic that ultimately strips away the charm of the original. It suffers from a weak script, uninspired performances, and a lack of the magic that made the 1937 classic so beloved.

The biggest issue lies in its reimagining of the characters and story. The attempt to update Snow White's character feels forced, and the absence of key elements such as the iconic dwarfs only makes it worse. The villain lacks the menacing presence of the animated Evil Queen, making the conflict feel dull and uninspired.

Despite a lavish production budget, the CGI is often distracting rather than immersive, and the musical numbers fail to leave an impression.

"By Ian Chandler - March 25, 2025

The 2025 remake of Disney's Snow White is unnecessary, but does it have to be rated as low as Manos: The Hands of Fate? The film stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the evil queen. First of all, I'll say that Zelger has an admittedly good voice, which is necessary for the musical numbers. However, the overall performances from the two leads are not outstanding. I don't know if it's because of the script, direction, or them eyeing a paycheck; whatever it is, the acting isn't exactly noteworthy. Despite the rough first impressions, this remake isn't nearly as soulless as the Lion King one from a few years ago. And, while I am at it, there is some, but not a sufficient amount of imagination in this project.

The film is a colorful adventure through and through. Some of the backgrounds pop with vibrancy and some of the CGI elements, mostly the animals, are adorable and expressive. However, the reliance on CGI is a bit on the heavy side, as it was also applied to the seven dwarves. Yes, you heard that right, the dwarves are CGI animations in this live-action remake. Have they forgotten about prosthetic makeup? They could have even pulled a trick from the Hobbit trilogy, where a taller character is on a green screen, enabling them to be digitally larger than the others. To give credit, though, these dwarves are expressive and are fun to be around.

The musical numbers are also a little forgettable, as the only one I could faintly remember is a song about whistling. The plot has similar beats to the original, but it seems to have taken some deviancies. Though I can see that angering some people, I am one of those people who likes to see some new ideas thrown in. Otherwise, you have virtually no reason to watch these remakes, as they are usually inferior to their source material. The pacing is also a little strange, as it is sometimes speedy, and other times it is as quick as a turtle. Neither are wrong by themselves, but the pacing must be consistent. The ending is a bit abrupt too.

The camerawork is nice, though. Some shots look rather good, but again, the overuse of CGI does hamper some to varying degrees. The goofy sequences with the dwarves are complimented by the zany cinematography. And just as mentioned before, the dwarves are easily the most enjoyable part of this movie. You might ponder whether or not it would have been a better idea to make a spinoff about their lifetimes instead. Even so, there is no reason for this film to be rated as low as 1.6! This movie? Sure, it is far from great, and it is a blatant cash grab; but there is some entertainment to be found here, at least. Also, it's far better than that Lion King remake. Though, I must mention, I haven't seen the original Snow White movie in full, despite how revolutionary and acclaimed it was. Perhaps that will invalidate some of my points here.

Score: 60/100

"When I watched this, the theatre was about empty (perhaps only around 20% occupancy) which was unusual for this kind of film featuring popular stories and casts. The film is basically visually stunning, but the casting is a disaster. Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot completely miss the mark-Zegler's performance feels totally forced, to be honest it was hard to watch, and Gadot lacks the menace needed for the Evil Queen. Strangely, the supporting cast feels more natural than the leads. The CGI, though, is amazing-the enchanted forest and Disney-style animal companions are a highlight. The story was altered to fit modern culture, which isn't the real issue-the weak performances are.

So many continuity issues to mention as well.

And 'Whistle while you work' was equally sweet and did have a smidge of that ol' Disney magic. But all of the new songs were instantly forgettable though. And Gal Gadot was not the evil queen we deserved. I had secretly hoped that Lana Parilla would be typecast into her role... because really, who could ever match her. Certainly not Gal. Her Evil Queen went out with a whizz pop, not a bang completely robbing us of seeing the comeuppance of good vs evil finale she (and the audience) deserved.

The casting choices are questionable at best. The lead performance lacks the warmth and charisma needed for the role, making it hard to connect with the character. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, delivering wooden performances that only add to the film's lack of emotional depth.

Visually, the movie looks like a cheap CGI overload. Instead of bringing the fairy tale to life, the effects look artificial and unconvincing, making scenes feel lifeless rather than magical. Even the costume and set designs fail to impress, looking uninspired and generic.

To top it off, the pacing is horrendous. The film drags in some parts and rushes through others, making it feel both boring and incoherent at the same time. Any attempt at humor falls flat, and there's no real sense of adventure or wonder-just a long, tedious experience that leaves you checking the time.

"When Disney decided to make a modern ""Snow White,"" they wanted to produce a contemporary adaptation of one of its cherished classic princess films that would appeal to everyone. Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away everything that made the original special leaving this poisoned apple of a film that is devoid of the life and magic of the original.

The dopey artistic and effects choices made in this version won't make anyone happy, either. There was too much singing and not enough storytelling leading to a rather tedious experience.

While some musical numbers show potential, they are overly produced, which can detract from the authenticity of the performances. Rachel's impressive vocal talent, particularly evident in ""Spellbound,"" illustrates this point. It appears that in some instances, the focus on production has overshadowed the importance of crafting a film that truly connects with audiences.

Additionally, the film appears to fall short of its potential, resembling a production more similar to a made-for-TV movie. Disney seems to be facing challenges in effectively leveraging computer-generated effects, in contrast to the proficiency demonstrated by other studios, leading to an approach that prioritizes quantity over quality.

"Hollywood has officially run out of ideas, and this new Snow White remake is proof. Instead of honoring the timeless charm of the original, this film strips away everything that made it special, replacing it with forced modern messaging, lackluster performances, and a complete misunderstanding of its own source material.

First, let's talk about the obvious-this was never a movie that needed a remake. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is a classic that set the foundation for Disney's golden age of animation. It was beautifully animated, had iconic music, and, most importantly, heart. This version, on the other hand, is a bland, CGI-heavy mess with none of the magic.

The casting choices and script changes feel more like a marketing stunt than an attempt to tell a good story. The removal of key elements (like the dwarfs) and the rewriting of Snow White's character into something completely unrecognizable only further prove that the filmmakers had no real interest in staying true to the fairy tale. Instead of an innocent, kind-hearted princess, we now get a modernized, independent warrior who looks down on the original story. And let's be honest-if you don't respect the source material, why even bother remaking it?

The visuals are another disappointment. Despite Disney's massive budget, the CGI looks lifeless, and the costume designs are forgettable at best. The film lacks the handcrafted beauty of the animated original and instead feels like yet another generic, over-processed live-action attempt that no one really asked for.

Disney used to be about storytelling. Now, it's about ticking boxes and making headlines. This movie isn't about nostalgia or bringing a classic to a new generation-it's about using a beloved brand to push a half-baked modern narrative while cashing in on a known IP.

At the end of the day, this Snow White remake is unnecessary, uninspired, and utterly forgettable.

"I loved the representation within the movie and the amazing visuals. The new Snow White movie, directed by Marc Webb and featuring Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, is a breathtaking reimagining of the beloved classic that successfully intertwines nostalgia with modern storytelling. With stunning visuals, a powerful soundtrack, and a fresh take on character development, this film is a must-see for both fans of the original and newcomers alike.

From the very first scene, the film captivates audiences with its enchanting visuals. The cinematography is nothing short of spectacular, showcasing lush forests, vibrant colors, and intricate set designs that bring the fairy tale world to life. Each frame feels like a painting, drawing viewers into the magical realm where Snow White resides. The attention to detail in costume design also deserves praise, as it beautifully reflects the characters' personalities and the film's overall aesthetic.

Rachel Zegler delivers a remarkable performance as Snow White, embodying the character's innocence, strength, and determination. Unlike the traditional portrayal of Snow White as merely a damsel in distress, this version presents her as a proactive and resilient young woman who is not afraid to stand up for herself and fight against injustice. Zegler's vocal talents shine in several musical numbers, adding depth to her character and making her journey even more relatable. Her chemistry with the supporting cast, particularly the seven dwarfs, is heartwarming and adds a layer of camaraderie that enhances the overall narrative.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is equally impressive. She brings a commanding presence to the role, effectively capturing the character's complexity. The film delves into the Queen's backstory, exploring her motivations and insecurities, which adds depth to her villainy. Gadot's performance is both fierce and vulnerable, making her a formidable antagonist while also eliciting sympathy from the audience. The dynamic between Snow White and the Evil Queen is central to the story, and their encounters are filled with tension and emotional weight.

The film's soundtrack is another standout feature, with original songs that perfectly complement the story. The music, composed by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, captures the essence of the characters and their journeys. Each song is intricately woven into the narrative, enhancing key moments and evoking a range of emotions. The musical numbers are choreographed beautifully, making them a joy to watch and listen to. The blend of classic fairy tale themes with contemporary musical styles creates a unique auditory experience that resonates with audiences of all ages.

One of the most significant aspects of this adaptation is its emphasis on themes of empowerment and self-discovery. The film encourages viewers to embrace their individuality and fight for what they believe in. Snow White's journey is not just about finding love but also about discovering her own strength and purpose. This modern twist on the story resonates strongly with today's audiences, making it relevant and inspiring.

While the film pays homage to the original animated classic, it also takes bold steps to innovate and challenge traditional narratives. The inclusion of diverse characters and perspectives adds richness to the story, allowing for a broader representation that reflects our world today. The seven dwarfs, portrayed by a talented ensemble cast, are given distinct personalities and backstories, making them more than just side characters. Their camaraderie with Snow White is heartwarming and adds layers to the film's narrative.

In terms of pacing, the film flows seamlessly, balancing moments of action, drama, and lightheartedness. The screenplay is well-crafted, with witty dialogue and poignant moments that keep the audience engaged throughout. The film's climax is thrilling and emotional, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats and ultimately delivering a satisfying conclusion.

Overall, the new Snow White movie is a triumph that successfully blends nostalgia with modern sensibilities. With its stunning visuals, powerful performances, and a compelling narrative, it stands out as a remarkable adaptation of a beloved fairy tale. This film is not just for children; it appeals to audiences of all ages, making it a cinematic experience worth sharing with family and friends. It's a refreshing reminder of the timelessness of fairy tales and the importance of courage, friendship, and self-empowerment.

"Unfortunately we reached a point where the expectations are set so low that even if the project itself is actually pretty decent (such as this picture) people are going to hate it no matter what.

Probably the biggest problem going into the movie is how inconsistent of a filmmaker Marc Webb is and obviously the elephant(s) I the room: Zegler and Gadot.

Zegler has some serious facial acting problems ant times and Gadot is well known as a mediocre actress at best, but Webb was actually able to somewhat hide those issues expertly.

Another really huge problem with Zegler was the fact that she's consider (by most) a worse looking woman than Gadot, but the casting choice was excellent with the direction that the screenplay took and didn't the fact that she's a black actress didn't feel forced at all.

Snow White herself is a charisma vacuum-wooden delivery, zero chemistry with anyone, and about as enchanting as a cold cup of tea. The dwarves? Barely there.

"Not sure why this got 2 stars. It is certainly not as bad as all that. The casting choice of Snow White was perfect. She perfectly embodies the Snow White persona. Innocent, charming, strong. The movie talks about how she was born during a snow storm and that is why she is named Snow White. She still has the short black hair and the yellow, blue and red dress so everyone can chill out.

They changed a few of the songs, which is a little bit of a disappointment, but I guess the old songs are a little dated with a girl waiting for her prince to come and save her. The movie flips that narrative and Snow White actually has to save the guy, who isn't even a prince, but a rebel against the queen.

Gal Gadot is fabulous in her Snow Queen dress and jewels. She does give off evil, which I love since she so often plays the heroine. Mirror needs to have his eyes checked bc the queen is definitely the fairest in the land with those stunning looks. But I think the mirror is looking at inner beauty too. Also the play on words that the queen may be fair in beauty, but she certainly is not fair to the people.

"Disney is flat. It lacks imagination, it lacks inspiration, it lacks style.

Making another version of this huge and mesmerising classic turns out to be a waste of money and time.

It's artificial. Like watching AI generated actors.

"Disappointed by the Casting - A Ruined Childhood Favorite

I was honestly heartbroken by this Snow White adaptation. The casting choice for the main character was incredibly poor and completely missed the essence of what Snow White represents. It felt like no effort was made to preserve the spirit of the original character - gentle, kind, and full of wonder.

This movie turned one of my most cherished childhood memories into something unrecognizable.

"I had high hopes for the 2025 ""Snow White,"" but it turned out to be one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a long time. What should have been a magical reimagining of a beloved classic turned into a drawn-out slog that left me checking my watch more than once.

The writing was painfully lackluster, filled with cringeworthy dialogue that felt more like a series of cliché catchphrases than genuine conversation. The plot meandered endlessly, lacking the charm and coherence that made the original so endearing. The awkward pacing made it hard to connect with any of the characters, particularly Snow White, who came off as bland and forgettable.

As for the cast, despite some commendable performances, they were working with very little. The dwarves, often the heart of the story, were reduced to caricatures, losing any semblance of depth or personality. Meanwhile, the villain was diminished to a mere shadow of her former self-more annoying than threatening.

Visually, while the film showcased some impressive scenery and effects, they often felt overused and distracting rather than enhancing the story. Instead of immersing us in the fairy tale world, it felt like a flashy cover hiding an empty shell.

"I can't believe how badly Disney's Snow White 2025 turned out. As a fan of the original classic, I was expecting a fresh, thoughtful retelling, but instead, I was left with a complete disappointment. This film was a waste of both my time and money.

The most glaring issue for me was the character of Snow White herself. Instead of being the strong, iconic figure she was in the original, she was reduced to a joke. Gone was the grace and depth that made her memorable. Instead, she was written as a clumsy, uninspiring character with no real substance. Her portrayal was not only disappointing but downright cringeworthy at times, making it hard to take the film seriously. The way they handled her role felt more like a parody than a reimagining of the beloved princess.

The performances across the board were underwhelming. Despite the film's star-studded cast, the acting was flat, and the chemistry between the characters felt forced. The dwarfs, instead of being endearing, felt awkward and out of place, and the film's attempt at humor fell painfully short.

Visually, the movie had some moments of impressive CGI, but even that couldn't mask the film's lack of heart. The effects felt overdone, and the magical elements didn't evoke the wonder they should have. The pacing was slow, and the plot was uninspired. The film didn't add anything meaningful to the classic story-it just tried to cash in on nostalgia without understanding why the original was so special.

Overall, Snow White 2025 is a prime example of a remake that misses the mark in every way.

"The 2025 Snow White movie is a complete letdown, failing to capture the magic of the original 1937 Disney classic. While the idea of reimagining such an iconic tale had potential, the final product falls short in almost every way.

Story & Plot: The plot itself is uninspired, offering little more than a dull retelling of the original story. While the 1937 version was groundbreaking, enchanting, and full of heart, this 2025 version misses the mark. It lacks the charm, the emotional depth, and the timeless appeal that made the original Snow White so memorable. The story feels rushed and shallow, with key moments that should have felt emotional or dramatic falling flat. It's a forgettable experience rather than a captivating reimagining.

The Lead Actor: Perhaps the biggest issue with this Snow White is the casting. The main actor simply does not fit the role. Snow White is supposed to be innocent, charming, and full of life-but in this version, the actor feels out of place. There's no warmth or connection with the audience. She fails to evoke the same tenderness and strength that made the 1937 Snow White a beloved character. It's hard to care about her journey when her portrayal feels so disconnected from the essence of the character.

Comparing to the 1937 Classic: It's clear that the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a far superior film. That version, with its groundbreaking animation and heartfelt storytelling, has remained a timeless classic for a reason. This 2025 retelling lacks the warmth, depth, and enchantment that made the original such a success. The performances were strong in 1937, with each character bringing something unique and memorable. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this modern version.

Conclusion: In short, the 2025 Snow White is a disappointing attempt at reviving a beloved classic. The story is flat, the lead actor is miscast, and it simply doesn't do justice to the original 1937 film. For anyone looking to relive the magic of Snow White, it's best to stick with the 1937 version, which remains the definitive and much more enjoyable take on the tale.

"I can't explain how disappointing this movie was. Simply disappointing. What the hell was that?

From the moment the first teaser dropped, Snow White (2025) sparked controversy, and unfortunately, the final product only amplified concerns. The decision to modernize the narrative by removing the prince and altering the portrayal of the seven dwarfs was seen as a significant departure from the original. Many fans who grew up with Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) were left confused and frustrated. This wasn't just a simple retelling-it was a complete overhaul of a beloved classic, one that left little resemblance to the timeless fairy tale.

Characterization & Performances

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen? Not for me. Sure, she looked the part-elegant, regal, and strikingly beautiful-but her performance lacked the gravitas needed to make the Queen truly menacing. Instead of exuding the chilling menace of the animated version, Gadot's Evil Queen often felt like a watered-down villain, more style than substance. Her character's motivations felt hollow, and despite her attempts to bring a sense of theatricality, it all fell flat.

Then there's Snow White herself. Snow White (played by Rachel Zegler) is no longer the passive princess waiting for true love's kiss. Instead, she is reimagined as an independent, strong-willed leader who dreams of ruling her kingdom without needing a prince. While the idea of a self-sufficient heroine is admirable, the execution left much to be desired. Instead of a charming and kind-hearted princess, this version of Snow White comes off as detached and, at times, unlikable. Zegler's performance is serviceable, but it lacks the warmth and sincerity that made the original character so endearing.

The Evil Queen (Gal Gadot) remains obsessed with Snow White's beauty, but the central conflict is now more about power than romance. While modernizing a fairy tale isn't inherently a bad thing, the way it was handled here stripped the story of its emotional core. The original Snow White wasn't just about romance-it was about kindness, innocence, and resilience. This version of the story, however, feels like a forced attempt to be ""progressive"" at the expense of its heart.

One of the most controversial changes is the complete removal of Prince Charming. While Disney has been moving away from the ""damsel in distress"" trope in recent years, the decision to remove the prince altogether left many fans wondering why the film was even called Snow White. The prince's role in the original was small, but his presence was symbolic. Here, the omission feels less like an organic change and more like an attempt to distance itself from traditional fairy tale elements entirely.

Additionally, the seven dwarfs are no longer the beloved, unique characters from the original but are instead replaced by a group of diverse magical creatures. This change, meant to be more ""inclusive,"" ended up alienating audiences even further. Fans cherished the dwarfs not just because they were short but because they each had distinct personalities that added charm and humor to the story. Replacing them with generic magical creatures resulted in a loss of character depth and emotional connection.

Visuals & Direction

Visually, Snow White has some beautiful moments. The cinematography is colorful and grand, and the costume design is impressive. However, the CGI used for the magical creatures and backgrounds feels inconsistent, making some scenes look artificial rather than immersive. There are moments of visual spectacle, but they are overshadowed by jarring CGI work that pulls you out of the experience rather than drawing you in.

The film's pacing also suffers, with certain moments dragging while others feel rushed. Scenes that should have been impactful lack weight, and the story's flow feels choppy. Director Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man) tries to inject a modern sensibility into the film, but the result feels disjointed. Instead of a timeless fairy tale, Snow White often feels like a generic fantasy film with a familiar name slapped onto it for brand recognition.

Final Verdict

Snow White had the potential to be a fresh and exciting update to a beloved classic. Instead, it comes off as a misguided attempt to modernize a story that didn't need drastic changes. With weak character development, controversial creative choices, and a script that feels more like a checklist of modern themes than a cohesive narrative, Snow White ultimately fails to capture the magic of the original.

At its core, Disney's Snow White feels like a film that doesn't know who it's for. It alienates fans of the original, disappoints those who wanted an exciting retelling, and frustrates audiences who wanted something more than a hollow attempt at ""progressive"" storytelling. If you were looking forward to a nostalgic, heartwarming experience, you won't find it here.

"Disney's latest take on Snow White is, quite simply, a baffling mess. From the moment the film begins, it's clear that creativity, effort, and even basic storytelling have taken a backseat. If you're looking for stunning visuals or a compelling narrative, look elsewhere-because what you'll find here is a film that feels uninspired, rushed, and painfully cringeworthy.

The graphics? Subpar. The writing? Lazy. The charm and magic Disney was once known for? Nowhere to be found. Instead, Snow White serves up a bland, lifeless experience that drains any excitement you might have had going in. If you're hoping for a modernized twist on a classic, prepare for disappointment. If you're simply looking to kill time, be warned-you may end up feeling even more bored than when you started.

"The acting in this film leaves much to be desired, as many performances feel flat and unconvincing, failing to bring the characters to life in a meaningful or engaging way. The emotional depth that made the original so compelling is largely absent, making it difficult to connect with the characters on any level. One of the most jarring aspects of this adaptation is the CGI dwarves, which are not only unsettling but outright terrifying. Their artificial, almost uncanny appearance makes them difficult to take seriously and significantly detracts from the overall viewing experience. Instead of enhancing the story, the CGI feels out of place and distracting, pulling focus away from the narrative and breaking immersion at key moments. The decision to use CGI in this way ultimately does a disservice to the film, making it feel more like an animated feature than a live-action adaptation. What made the original so special was its charm, warmth, and the authenticity of its characters, but much of that has been stripped away in favor of a visually flashy but emotionally hollow experience. The heart of the story seems to have been lost in the process, replaced with a cold, artificial aesthetic that fails to capture the magic and wonder of the original. Instead of feeling like a loving tribute or a fresh take, this version comes across as a misguided attempt to modernize something that never needed changing in the first place.",1/10,acting film leaves much desired many performances feel flat unconvincing failing bring characters life meaningful engaging way emotional depth made original compelling largely absent making difficult connect characters level one jarring aspects adaptation cgi dwarves unsettling outright terrifying artificial almost uncanny appearance makes difficult take seriously significantly detracts overall viewing experience instead enhancing story cgi feels place distracting pulling focus away narrative breaking immersion key moments decision use cgi way ultimately disservice film making feel like animated feature adaptation made original special charm warmth authenticity characters much stripped away favor visually flashy emotionally hollow experience heart story seems lost process replaced cold artificial aesthetic fails capture magic wonder original instead feeling like loving tribute fresh take version comes across misguided attempt modernize something never needed changing first place,0.9432,0.248,0.127,0.624

"This film is awful! The visuals feel uninspired, with CGI that looks more dated than dazzling, and the script is a dull, lifeless retread of better adaptations.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen wasn't just disappointing - it was downright painful. Her performance felt more like a bored celebrity cameo than a menacing, iconic villain. Every line delivery was stiff and lifeless, making it impossible to take her seriously.

Instead of the regal, terrifying presence we expected, we got awkward smirks and a flat, fashion-model-gone-bad vibe. No depth, no menace - just a face doing a bad impression of a villain.

"I went into Snow White (2025) hoping for a fresh take on a beloved classic, but what I got was an absolute mess. From the uninspired performances to the baffling creative choices, this movie fails on every level.

First, the script is unbearably dull, filled with lifeless dialogue and forced ""modern"" updates that strip away the charm of the original. The changes to the story feel unnecessary and out of place, turning an enchanting fairy tale into a preachy, joyless slog.

The casting is another major issue. The lead performance lacks charisma, making Snow White more annoying than endearing. The supporting characters are forgettable, and the film completely mishandles its interpretation of the dwarfs, replacing them with unmemorable stand-ins that add nothing to the story.

Visually, it's a mixed bag. While some of the CGI looks decent, many scenes feel overly artificial and uninspired. The costumes and set design are bland, failing to capture the magic of the original film. Even the musical numbers, which should be a highlight, are flat and unmemorable.

Overall, Snow White (2025) is a soulless cash grab that completely misses the heart of the story. Instead of celebrating a classic, it awkwardly tries to ""modernize"" it in all the wrong ways. Disney needs to stop with these lifeless remakes and start focusing on original storytelling again.

"Talk about your strange (really, really BAD) casting choices and mismatched talent! Rachel Zegler as the ""... fairest of them all"" while Gal Gadot comes in at second place creates a dissonance for the audience while trying to watch the movie. Nothing against Rachel whatsoever, but she should've been the queen because she looks so much older than Gal Gadot (who really shouldn't have even been in this production in the first place).

Gal Gadot has a ton of presence on screen. It's just too much for her to be cast as the second fiddle. If she's in a scene, all eyes are immediately on her, she's got the audience's sympathy and attention, and if she isn't the story, the story seems less significant like background or filler.

The last time I can recall such poorly matched stars in a movie was Titanic.

"Even though her voice is great, it's funny that she's Latina-and so is her mother. She doesn't portray any of Snow White's sweetness; she's just angry at the Queen all the time. She can be angry, but there still needs to be some of Snow White's innocence and gentleness. Even when she sings, she doesn't feel like a princess at all. I felt like she was playing Lucy Gray again.

As for the Queen, she's just beautiful-there's no real menace in her performance. The dwarfs are cute, though. The storyline mostly follows the original, just without the prince.

"Disney's Snow White (2025) is an absolute trainwreck of a film, a soulless, pandering mess that takes everything magical about the original and grinds it into a pile of corporate-approved sludge. From the moment the film starts, it's clear that no one involved actually cared about the heart of the story-instead, we're subjected to a joyless, preachy rehash that feels like it was assembled by a boardroom of executives desperate to check off every modern talking point rather than tell a compelling fairy tale. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a complete misfire, a character so stripped of her original warmth and kindness that she might as well be an entirely different person. Gone is the gentle, hopeful princess who charmed animals and won over the dwarfs with her sincerity; in her place is a smirking, self-righteous bore who delivers cringeworthy one-liners and spends more time lecturing the audience than embodying any real fairy-tale spirit. Zegler's performance lacks any trace of the wide-eyed wonder that made Snow White iconic-instead, she comes across as disinterested, almost annoyed to be in the role, and her singing, while technically fine, feels autotuned and devoid of emotion, as if even the music was an afterthought in this hollow production. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is another colossal disappointment, a villain who should have been a scene-stealing force of malice but instead stumbles through the film with all the intimidation of a disgruntled influencer. Gadot looks the part, sure, but her delivery is wooden, her menace nonexistent, and her attempts at dramatic flair fall completely flat. The famous ""Mirror, Mirror"" scene, once a chilling highlight of the original, is reduced to a lifeless exchange with zero tension, thanks to terrible pacing and a script that seems determined to undermine any sense of stakes. The Queen's backstory, a half-baked attempt at forced sympathy, only makes her less compelling, robbing her of the pure, delicious wickedness that made her such a memorable antagonist. Then there are the dwarfs-or rather, the bizarre, identity-less creatures Disney has replaced them with in a transparent attempt to dodge controversy. Stripped of their distinct personalities, they're reduced to a bland, interchangeable group of CGI-enhanced nobodies who contribute nothing to the story. There's no Grumpy, no Dopey, no Sleepy-just a handful of forgettable sidekicks who exist solely to nod along to Snow White's uninspiring monologues. The decision to sideline them in favor of this watered-down, politically safe alternative is cowardly, and worse, it's boring, sucking out yet another layer of charm from what should have been a lively, whimsical adventure. Even the Prince, already a thinly written character in the original, is somehow made even more irrelevant, appearing only long enough to remind us that Disney had no idea what to do with him. The romance, if you can even call it that, is completely lifeless, with zero chemistry between the leads and a rushed, unconvincing ""connection"" that feels like it was added out of obligation rather than any genuine storytelling need. The film's visuals are just as uninspired, with cheap-looking CGI backdrops and a color palette so dull it feels like the movie was shot through a layer of grime. The enchanted forest, once a place of wonder, now resembles a low-budget video game cutscene, and the animals-previously a delightful part of Snow White's world-move with all the natural grace of glitchy robots. The musical numbers, supposedly one of Disney's biggest strengths, are shockingly forgettable, with new songs that evaporate from memory the second they end and reworked classics that lack any of the original's spark. The humor, what little there is, lands with a thud, relying on painfully forced modern quips that clash horribly with the fairy-tale setting. Every creative decision in this film feels calculated, focus-grouped, and utterly devoid of passion, as if the entire production was engineered to avoid offending anyone rather than to entertain. The result is a movie that pleases no one-too sanitized to satisfy fans of the original, too bland to win over new audiences, and too afraid of its own legacy to take any real risks. It's a film that exists solely because Disney knows the name ""Snow White"" will sell tickets, no matter how little effort they put into it. By the time the limp, anticlimactic finale rolls around, the only emotion it inspires is relief that it's finally over. This isn't just a bad remake-it's a depressing testament to how far Disney has fallen, trading timeless storytelling for hollow, market-tested mediocrity.

"I watched Snow White having not read any other reviews and without reading about the controversies surrounding it and i thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the new songs and the choreo and direction within them. I thought the costumes were spot on and smiled when we saw Snow White in her traditional dress in the woods. I also liked Rachel Ziegler in the role. Her character had an edge to her which I didn't think I was going to like but her direction and the more determined characterisation, I think, suited her. I liked the CGI 'dwarfs' , each one reminding us in subtle ways of the quirks which gave them their names. I found Dopey adorable... The CGI woodland animals were very very cute. Yes, there are some parts of the story which have been updated but not to the extent that it detracts or ruins the plot. So what if the male lead and 'dwarfs' all work as a team with Snow White to bring down the evil queen standing back for Snow White to take the final lead - love it.

The agenda, the message, the disregard for history, character development, narrative.

I'm predicting the kids will have nightmares from those 7 abhorations Disney threw at us.

For us older viewers, it's impossible to watch the film and see Zegler on the screen without immediately thinking about her toxic entitled rhetoric in all interviews given to promote the film and it immediately takes you out of the picture until those terrifying little people return to zap you away from your thoughts and back into terror.

Gadot should have been wonderful as the evil queen but somehow she just wasn't.

"The remake of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" fell flat for several reasons, leaving audiences disappointed. It lacked the charm and magic of the original, leaning heavily on modernized storytelling that felt forced and out of sync with the beloved classic. Key characters were poorly developed, and the dynamic between Snow White and the dwarves, which was central to the original, felt watered down. Additionally, the production decisions, such as uninspired set designs and lackluster special effects, failed to evoke the whimsical fairy-tale ambiance that fans cherish. Many viewers felt the remake prioritized style over substance, leaving behind the heart and soul of the story that made the original an enduring masterpiece. It serves as a reminder that reimagining a classic requires capturing the essence of the original while adding fresh, meaningful layers-not just superficial updates.",1/10,remake snow white seven dwarves fell flat several reasons leaving audiences disappointed lacked charm magic original leaning heavily modernized storytelling felt forced sync beloved classic key characters poorly developed dynamic snow white dwarves central original felt watered additionally production decisions uninspired set designs lackluster special effects failed evoke whimsical ambiance fans cherish many viewers felt remake prioritized style substance leaving behind heart soul story made original enduring masterpiece serves reminder reimagining classic requires capturing essence original adding fresh meaningful superficial updates,0.9623,0.308,0.087,0.605
"Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White is nothing short of a disaster. Instead of embodying the warmth, charm, and innocence that made the original character so beloved, she delivers a performance that feels forced, detached, and utterly lifeless. Her line delivery lacks emotion, her expressions are awkward, and at times, it seems like she's just reading from a script rather than bringing a character to life.

There's no sincerity in her performance, and her attempts at conveying strength or independence come off as shallow and uninspired. Even her interactions with other characters feel unnatural, as if she's simply going through the motions without any genuine connection. In a film that desperately needed a strong lead to carry its modernized vision, Zegler's flat, charisma-free acting drags the entire movie down.

"I really wanted to like this. I really did. I was familiar with all the negative comments prior to its opening, but I have seen many fine films attacked unfairly for a variety of reasons that I've ended up loving. I do not allow critic reviews or peoples opinions to determine my love of a film I wanted SNOW WHITE to be one that was maligned by others but loved by me. Sadly, it wasn't. Even at an hour and 49 minutes the movie drags terribly. I was bored too much of the time. There are subplots to the original story that come out of nowhere that make little sense to why they are there other than to give the old story a little kick. The message that is sent at the end is a good one, but it's conveyed too late in the story and not strong enough. The mixture of live action and CGI occasionally blend nicely, but all too often reminds one of the process and takes the viewer out of the story. I kept thinking ""why didn't they just stick to the original and make the entire movie CGI""? That would've been more visually exciting than the weird combination of dark effects you get here. Poor Rachel Zegler has a nice persona, but doesn't possess the necessary ""magic"" needed for the character. She's stuck in a dull fantasy where too much responsibility is placed upon her to hold together. She's frankly a little too mature for the part of Snow White and while Gal Gadot works valiantly to muster evil in every expression, the woman is too nice and friendly looking to ever be perceived as frightening or evil. She and Zegler could easily switch roles. The one nice piece of casting is Andrew Burnap who is at home in these type of surroundings and is refreshing as the counter part to the Prince. The CGI Dwarfs, rather than endearing, often made me cringe in embarrassment. I might have warmed up to the picture if the score was good. It isn't. The new songs are horribly monotone sounding like they're trying desperately to be like prior Disney musicals. I really hated the score.

"This movie is a textbook example of how to alienate the very people who would have supported it.

Disappointing and Uninspired - A Letdown for Fans

I had high hopes for the new Snow White, but unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the most disappointing adaptations I've seen. The film completely lacks the magic and charm of the original, replacing it with a dull, uninspired story that feels forced rather than heartfelt. The lead performance is underwhelming, and the changes to the classic characters and themes feel unnecessary and, frankly, disrespectful to the beloved source material.

A touching remake with a twist of update to the story. Voices are beautiful new songs and funny witty lines. Dwarfs were great especially Dopey.

"Or do actually. Here's why: I've just left the theatre and think this is a new age, war driven ""no wireeeee hanggerrrrrrssss"" performance. This movie is a pretty faithful adaptation to the animated version. There's a bit more dialogue and a lot more singing. But the story is the same? I didn't expect that. The CGI was not as distracting as I suspected? Definitely didn't expect that. And the entire cast did great except she who must not be named. GG should have her Hollywood star removed because of this performance. I don't personally like her acting choices, or lack ever thereof. And I find her politically to be in the same camp. She's been a major skip and I hope this solidifies her unbankability going forward. She, like the apple she gives out is box office poison. Her costumes were as horrible as her performance was campy. And I do not mean like good The Substance camp, nor But I'm a Cheerleader camp, just really really bad Joan Crawford impressionist camp. The castle might've been a literal putt putt course? And the seven emotions in human form were a little uncanny valley vibes at times but I think lord farquad Snow White did good in her 507 songs that she sang running through the forest hiding in the worlds brightest yellow dress you've ever seen. There were a lottttt of similarities in the script to the ongoing war in the Middle East, with Gal as the rightful villain but I'm not sure that the studio knows that it even did that. Nor that she's aware, clearly. It's either a brilliant calculation or a ""mistake"" on Disney's part. Rachel (lord farquad snow) has spoken out advocating for history's correct side and her being on the run from terror was honestly about as close to reality any Disney movie has ever gotten.

"I didn't know it was possible to take a beloved fairytale and strip it of all its magic, but Disney's live-action Snow White manages to do just that-and then some. This film is a hollow, lifeless shell of the original, bloated with awkward dialogue, cringeworthy attempts at modern messaging, and some of the worst CGI I've seen in years. Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is painfully flat, lacking any real emotion or charm, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen comes off like a bored fashion model trying to act menacing but never quite getting there. The sets look fake, the colors are garish, and the entire film feels like it was created by a marketing algorithm rather than storytellers with any passion. It's not whimsical or empowering-it's just dull, soulless, and nearly impossible to sit through without checking the time every five minutes.

"I approached this ""adaptation"" with a cautious optimism, but it quickly devolved into a baffling cinematic experience. It's a tragedy to witness a beloved animated classic so thoroughly mishandled in the name of ""modernization."" Disney should have simply created an original film. The narrative felt disjointed and misdirected, while the CGI was jarringly poor, creating a disconnect from any sense of immersion. My three-year-old, accustomed to the animated version, was visibly upset by the jarring visual differences. The casting choices were questionable, with a lead actress lacking the necessary charisma to carry such an iconic role. The script meandered, and the acting, in general, was wooden and unconvincing. This film embodies everything that's wrong with contemporary cinema's approach to classic adaptations. It's a complete disaster, and a profound disappointment.

"As someone who grew up loving Snow White, I was genuinely looking forward to this new version. But right from the beginning, it was hard to stay engaged - mainly because the casting of Snow White just doesn't work.

The role of Snow White has always carried a certain image: soft-spoken, kind-hearted, and with a kind of timeless beauty that fits the fairy-tale world. Unfortunately, the actress in this adaptation doesn't quite capture any of that. Her presence on screen feels out of sync with the character's essence - both in how she looks and how she carries the role. There's a noticeable lack of warmth and that dreamy, classic charm you'd expect.

Reinterpreting a story is one thing, but when the lead feels miscast, it makes it difficult to connect with the film at all.

"I had low expectations for Snow White 2025, but somehow it still managed to underwhelm. The film takes a beloved story and drowns it in heavy-handed messaging, clunky dialogue, and a plot that feels like it was stitched together by a committee with no clear vision. The CGI is shockingly subpar-think early 2000s video game cutscenes-and the dwarfs (or whatever they're calling them now) are reduced to forgettable caricatures that add nothing to the story.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White tries hard, but the script gives her little to work with; she oscillates between wooden and overly dramatic without finding a believable middle ground. The songs, which should've been a highlight, are forgettable at best and cringe-inducing at worst- autotune can't save lyrics that sound like they were written by an AI with no soul. The pacing drags, stretching a simple fairy tale into a bloated 2-hour slog that left me checking my watch.

In fact I think this movie was more musical theatre than a big screen film. I felt like they may have spent the majority of the budget to get Gal to do the movie, she didn't have a huge amount of lines and what she did have she over acted in them.

The female lead playing Snow White was a great actress but I also think it was just rubbish directing and and musical theatre

The story was odd, think of Snow White, the seven dwarves and Robin and his merry men. It was hard to watch. Like I said, if I was a 10 year old girl I probably would have loved it.

"Snow White (2025) : Movie Review -

Disney is approaching its centennial, and over these 100 years, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) continues to be the BIGGEST HIT they ever produced (109 million tickets sold in North America). Unsure why they decided to redo the iconic film after 90 years, only to tarnish their own legacy. Snow White is a cheerful movie, until you reach the climax, which kills it more than the poisoned apple ever could. Even though it's a borrowed tale, you'll observe the alterations and additions in the script and wonder, ""who approved these clichés?""

In the opening scene, if the younger version of Snow White appears more beautiful than the adolescent version of Snow White, then you've started off on the wrong foot, mate. If the magic mirror reveals that Rachel Zegler is more beautiful and fairer than Gal Gadot, then you certainly have a problematic product on your hands. If your movie doesn't conclude with the ""true love kiss,"" you've really failed it. If the Evil Queen can be vanquished through conversation, then I have no interest, Marc brother.

The tale of Snow White, as everyone knows, revolves around Snow White (both externally and internally) who is turned into a servant by the Evil Queen. The Evil Queen has taken great pride in being the fairest of all, but her arrogance is shattered when the magic mirror reveals that Snow White is the fairest. The Queen now desires Snow White, also known as the Princess, to be dead, but she is granted life by her killer and is left to reside in an enchanted forest. The princess seeks refuge in the sole house she spots, owned by seven dwarfs, each representing a different human emotion-Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. The princess is looking for her father but the dwarfs ask her to stay here, stay safe; will she listen?

In contrast to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, this remake portrays the Prince in a new way-as a Rebel, specifically speaking. Why the hell did you do that? As stated earlier, the true Love's kiss seems ineffective as it doesn't create that singular ideal moment of a ""perfect Happy ending."" The film runs longer from there. Snow White's musical pieces are effective at certain moments, but others can be very dull. Certain dialogues are also not positioned effectively. Quite reminiscent of the legendary conversation between Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart about ""how to whistle"" in ""To Have and Have Not"" (1944), our Snow White instructs Dopey and the other dwarfs on the same topic, namely, ""how to whistle."" That appeared adorable, however. Additionally, numerous scenes in the movie appeared delightful and joyful, including the introduction of animals, the opening song featuring the seven dwarfs, and the house cleaning sequence. On the downside, the film overlooked some stunning scenes from the original, with my favorite being Snow White's joyful gathering with birds and animals at home.

Regarding performances, I think Snow White had the potential to be much better than how the actors have portrayed it. Rachel Zegler appears excessively white and fair, yet she was decent overall. Gal Gadot's accent appeared more English this time, surprisingly, yet the character didn't resonate effectively. Andrew Burnap portrays the new character, who, despite his satisfactory to reasonable performance, appears entirely out of place in the context. The backing of Ansu Kabia, Patrick Page, and Hadley Fraser was barely perceptible, while all those seven dwarfs appeared cute on occasion but visually unappealing at other times. One cannot be so childish with a $250 million budget film.

Snow White lacks captivating music and visual charm, which are essential for any live-action adaptation. Disney is undoubtedly running low on concepts, which is why they are recreating many of their legendary blockbusters. I firmly believe that Snow White wasn't the appropriate choice for the remake era. The visual effects are even worse than you'd imagine, and the casting of Zegler and Gadot in specific roles is surely one of the biggest F-ups in recent memory. Marc Webb's contemporary take on the cult classic nearly won me over; indeed, Disney's Snow White was almost a winner, until it lost to its own potential and legacy. The final 20-25 minutes of the film have turned it into a terrible remake by far; I mean, it completely lost me during that part. If there were no Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, then Snow White could have possibly worked for me. But what would Disney have been without Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? I suppose nothing. However, Disney without Snow White would have had ""no impact"" on the world. So, skip watching it if you cherish, admire, and honor the original. Let Disney suffer.

"Unfortunately all this movie does is remind of how amazing Disney's 1937 classic is. The characters are generally flat. The evil queen's ""evil"" just doesn't come through; I wish I could blame it solely on Disney's storyboarding, but Ms. Gadot's performance does the character no favors. Ms. Zegler took on no small challenge in her role reprising the character representing peak Disney fantasy and magic. I would forgive any inherent misses in her acting prowess (or lack thereof), but it's all but impossible to get past Disney's modernization of her character. Modernization in itself is no problem (see Baz Luhrmann's take on a story 400 years its senior), but Disney failed to adjust Snow White's entire formula, leaving the viewer to cherry pick when, where, and how to suspend disbelief in an otherwise magical character. The most egregious disappointment was the dwarves. Again, Disney has failed to recognize that the rubber-banded rag doll humor of the 1937 dwarves simply cannot be duplicated in CG, especially when the art design can't decide where it belongs in the spectrum of ""real to ""cartoon"". Remakes are inherently at a disadvantage; still, Disney made specific plot and character choices to resonate with some recent quakes in popular culture: that was a mistake.

He never speaks or sings . But he does cry at the end of the movie. The opening sequence I don't remember Snow White mentioning her parents. And her father being killed by the wicked queen was never mentioned in the cartoon. The the queen played by gal gadot she did a good job playing the queen . But what didn't surprise was that she talks to the magic mirror more times than. In the cartoon she talks to the mirror 2 times. In the original cartoon the queen dies from being killed by a rock during the rainstorm. In this new version their queen breaks the mirror and kills her which is not quite right. And Snow White running the dark forest was not as scary as I remember. And when she meets the forest animals she sings with a smile and a song . But I'm glade they kept heigh ho and added more notes to the song . The old hag the queen disguises herself wasn't that scary. In the original movie the old hag is more terrifying the way Walt Disney pictured . I feel like Disney should've been more respectful to the original classic from 1937 88 years ago.

"Completely strays away from the original story completely. Snow white is also portrayed as a very 'sassy' character with an attitude problem.

Aside from some of the songs being catchy, it was hard to watch, without falling asleep.

The story behind the name Snow white, is different. Despite there being 7 dwarves in the film, they were unconvincing, and would have been better to cast actual actors to play them instead of CGI.

The evil witch played by Gal Gadot was average in terms of acting, but again, the storyline of her was very much different to the original story.

Snow White is a disappointing and joyless reimagining that strips away the charm and wonder of the original.

"Snow White tries to simultaneously be a complete reinvention of the animated original and a very faithful adaptation where scenes are lifted directly from its predecessor so the results are undoubtedly messy but it avoids being the worst Disney live action remake. It tries to fix most of the problems with its source material in a noble fashion and a lot of the new ideas work well enough, they just almost go unnoticed thanks to the couple of truly baffling ones.

Rachel Zegler is this film's saving grace. Her fantastic singing voice gets plenty of moments to shine and she consistently imbues the film with all the necessary warmth and elegance despite everything working against her, mainly the unflattering haircut she has and some uncanny scene partners. Gal Gadot gives a career worst performance, even if she's clearly relishing the villainy she gets to play it's just so painful to watch, especially when she starts singing.

The no longer titular seven dwarves are relentlessly uncanny and the camera gets way too close to them most of the time which only makes it worse. The second they appear the film goes straight into the uncanny valley and even though they remain a jolly highlight throughout as they did in the original, it's never enough to fully escape it. It's such a strange (at best) creative choice however, the new character arc given to Dopey really works.

Marc Webb's direction is completely authorless and it makes no sense that he'd choose to make this after the notoriously tumultuous production of his Amazing Spider-Man duology under Sony. There's some vibrant sequences and it's generally pretty colourful, only employing a bland grey palette for scenes where it kinda fits.

"Movie completely misses the mark. While it tries to appeal to modern sensibilities, the result is a dull and uninspired retelling of the classic. The once magical elements are now lifeless, and the over-reliance on CGI makes the world feel artificial rather than enchanting. The film drags on with long, unnecessary scenes that leave you checking the time.

What's worse is that even children, who are the target audience, seemed uninterested and restless. The movie's attempt at humor is forced, and the characters, especially Snow White, are one-dimensional. The dwarfs, who were supposed to be quirky and lovable, feel flat and unremarkable. There's no heart in this version, and it struggles to capture the essence of the original tale, leaving viewers-young and old-feeling bored and disconnected.

In an era where we've seen fantastic retellings, this movie fails to deliver anything fresh or engaging.

"Snow White is the newest Disney live action remake, and it isn't bad. But could be better. The most controversial part about this film is Rachel Zegler, but she is the best part of this movie. The girl knows how to sing (like we saw on hunger games, and other films), and she sings beautifully in this movie. Speaking of singing, the songs in this movie aren't bad. Most of the Disney life action remake don't have good original songs but when you switch over to this movie, there's actually a handful amount of them that I find really good and catchy. Now Gal Gadot is getting hated in this movie saying it is her worst performance yet but the way I see it. She almost matched the role of the evil queen perfectly, now I do have a few Nitpicks, but I didn't hate her performance. And this movie fixed all of my problems that I had with the original film, the pacing is better in this movie and we fleshed out the characters more instead of the storylines being rushed. All my problems with the original film isn't in this movie, so theoretically that will make this movie better than the original. But this movie introduced new problems that stop it from being better than the original. First off the movie feels like a completely different story. It has the Snow White story in there, but the overall story with the evil queen and Snow White royalty is completely different and just doesn't match the classic that we know. Makes it feel like a completely different movie and that they only put Snow White in this movie so that people went out and saw it. Earlier I did talk about Gal Gadot and how she matched the evil queen almost perfectly with her performance. But her singing sounds awful in here, I never liked the song She's singing in this movie and her performance doesn't help. She's singing in the way that doesn't really match the evil queen. And the song just sounds completely off and the song just feels forced into the movie. I do think the first hour of this movie is really solid, but the second half of the movie is where it started to really go downhill. Partially because that's where the new story comes into play, but it also captured none of the magic that the original Snow White movie had. And the romance just felt forced, it felt like they only had the romance in there just for snow White to wake up from the poison apple. And the CGI dwarfs don't look as bad as they did in the trailer, but they still don't look good. I don't understand why they didn't hire an actual person to play the role instead of the CGI dwarfs. But overall, Snow White still at least captures the same magic that the original classic had, and fixing a lot of my problems that I had of the original movie. But they changed so much of the story that it just doesn't feel like the same movie anymore and feels like a completely different movie, but a boring plot that doesn't capture the same magic that the original movie had.

"We gave it a shot-my entire family sat down genuinely hoping Snow White (2025) would be worth the time. It wasn't. The film is an unwatchable mess, a complete butchering of the original story that seems more focused on making a statement than telling a coherent tale. It abandons everything that made the classic beloved, replacing heart and imagination with awkward messaging and shallow characters. The visuals are equally disastrous. The animation quality is shockingly poor for a modern production; I've seen more polished work from indie studios over a decade ago.

Yet another live-action adaptation that strips away the magic of the original. The film feels soulless, bogged down by forced modern updates that add nothing meaningful to the story.

"Ouch! Now this was always going to be a difficult story to imaginatively reimagine, and I do wonder just who Disney thought this was for as it quite radically alters the timeless fairy tale and augments it with some remarkably unremarkable power ballads and set piece choreography that wouldn't have looked out of place at a barn dance. This iteration of the story pretty much abandons the fantasy elements of the original one and tells us of a wicked queen who has tricked her way onto the throne and turned the princess ""Snow White"" (Rachel Zegler) into something more akin to a royal ""Cinderella"". Luckily for her, she encounters the enthusiastic bandit ""Jonathan"" (Andrew Burnap) who has broken into the palace to pinch some spuds, and next thing they are both trying to stay one step ahead of the Queen (Gal Gadot) who is narked by her mirror telling her she's just plain ugly so she wants them deceased! It does swing by the brothers Grimm every now and again, and there are seven singing dwarves to ""work the whole day long"", but even they can't breathe much life into this surprisingly mundane exercise in superb technical creativity but otherwise lacklustre amateur stage theatricals. The unmistakably familiar score from Messrs. Pasek and Paul keeps threatening to break into ""You Will Be Found"" from ""Dear Evan Hansen"" and aside from, perhaps, ""Waiting on a Wish"" the soundtrack - like the whole thing - is disappointingly forgettable as it avoids every potential hint of menace progressing through a fondue of gloop towards it's conclusion. Thank heavens for ""Grumpy"" (Martin Kleppa) who is probably the only one on-screen in synch with those of us watching. If you do want to see it then cinema is definitely best.

Her line delivery lacks emotion, and there's no real charm or innocence in her portrayal. In key emotional moments, she fails to bring depth.

One of the biggest issues with this film is how drastically it deviates from the source material.

"What's the point of making a live-action version of a very old animated film if it's going to change absolutely everything that made the original story good? I simply don't understand the decisions that were made. I didn't mind the small change in the cast or the random selection of actors and actresses for the casting. But you can't change the entire story: the beginning, the middle, and the end. You also can't change the personalities of the main characters, much less minimize the evilness of the villain just because she's a woman.

"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is so astoundingly awful, so fundamentally broken, that you wonder how anyone involved thought it was a good idea. Snow White (2024) isn't just bad-it's an unwatchable, soulless, insult to cinema. This isn't a movie; it's a dumpster fire set ablaze by Disney's own arrogance and creative bankruptcy.

A Character Assassination of Snow White The original Snow White was a timeless classic with a kind-hearted heroine. This version? A smug, bitter, self-righteous shell of a character who lacks any warmth or charm. Rachel Zegler's performance is as grating as her off-screen comments about how much she despises the original film. Instead of a fairy tale princess, we get a condescending know-it-all who sneers at the very idea of romance, heroism, or anything remotely resembling a compelling story arc.

The ""Dwarfs"" - Or Whatever They Are In what can only be described as one of the worst creative decisions in cinematic history, Disney removed the iconic Seven Dwarfs and replaced them with... a random group of people with no personality, no chemistry, and no reason to exist. They're so forgettable that calling them ""characters"" feels generous. It's like they grabbed a bunch of extras from a failed Netflix show and told them to stand around in the background.

A CGI Catastrophe Visually, Snow White (2024) is an absolute eyesore. The special effects look unfinished, the cinematography is flat and lifeless, and the color grading makes everything look like it was filmed through a dirty window. The original film from 1937-hand-drawn frame by frame-has more life, beauty, and artistry than this entire multimillion-dollar disaster.

Disney's Most Boring Movie Ever If this film had any redeeming qualities-funny moments, an emotional core, or even decent action-it might at least be watchable. But there's nothing. The script is atrocious, the pacing is a disaster, and the entire movie is so lifeless that it feels like a punishment to sit through. Every scene drags on with awkward dialogue and dull performances, making Snow White feel like a two-hour endurance test.

Final Verdict: A Career-Ending Disaster Snow White (2024) isn't just the worst Disney remake-it might be the worst thing the studio has ever produced. It's an insult to the original, a disaster of storytelling, and proof that modern Disney has lost every shred of creativity. Avoid this mess at all costs.

"""Snow White and the seven dwarf"" is a master piece not only in Disney history, but also in the cinema industry. This move remake is an insult to the original and the cast is not, at all, up to the task. Watch the original if you want to see a wonderful movie, not this one.

"There were many aspects of this movie that went above and below expectations. As someone who was ecstatic about this movie, it was a little underwhelming, but it did have its positives.

On one hand, the movie was overall entertaining. The ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""A Hand Meets a Hand"" were catchy additions to the soundtrack, and the additions to the storyline fit well within Disney's intentions to modernize them and add to the classic. For example, expanding upon the love interests involvement in the story and making him less of a random guy that shows up to kiss her eventually was a good way to make his involvement in the film less random. Developing their relationship gave more meaning to her awakening. Visually, the CGI for the mines and the forest scene were pretty cool. I also liked how they made the dwarfs more interesting as creatures. That is about as far as the positives for the film extend.

There was a lot to unpack with the negative parts of the movie. The Evil Queen's performance felt forced, flat, and just overall hard to watch. Snow White's hair has its ups and downs, but ultimately looked like lord farquaad when it mattered. The CGI dwarfs were kind of spooky, but not that bad. I understand what people mean when they say that you could tell that everything was sets, but that shouldn't take away from the details in the sets such as with the outside and inside of the cottage. The chemistry between Snow White and Johnathan was a little awkward. No, I don't think Snow White's outfit was horrendous and hideous. I actually liked that they gave her ballet shoes, because who is actually running around a Forrest in heels and not losing them?

The biggest things to remember are that first of all, these movies aren't just for fans of the original, but also for children who just want to see real-life princesses, and that this was a reimagining more than a remake. If you watch the movie, keep your standards to a minimum. If you pick apart everything about the movie, of course you're not going to enjoy it.

"I watched this hoping for a fresh but respectful take on a beloved classic. What I got instead was a confusing, soulless shell of what Snow White once represented. The heartwarming story has been replaced with shallow dialogue, miscast actors, and visuals that feel like a rushed video game cutscene.

This Snow White remake is a soulless, cringe-inducing disaster that feels like it was written by people who have never actually enjoyed a Disney movie in their lives.

The lead performance? Flat. The dialogue? Laughable. The CGI? Somehow worse than movies from 20 years ago. The heart and magic that made the original timeless? Completely obliterated. It's like they actively tried to suck all the fun and charm out of it.

Leave the old stories the way they were intended to be, and if you have a problem with them, write something new and different! This movie had no redeeming qualities. Queen was dull, Snow White was uninspiring, and the dwarves completely lacked their original charm.

Viewers, keep in mind that this was supposed to be an IMPROVEMENT to the backlash they originally got when they first released the trailer with the weird CGI-shrunken-live-actors.

Originally, they used live actors and used CGI to shrink them instead of, idk, using real dwarf actors and giving them a chance at the kind of national exposure a Disney move tends to provide???? That's why they were so dull and lifeless they were a cheap bandaid fix to a deeper problem.

"N Disney's 2025 live-action adaptation of ""Snow White,"" Gal Gadot portrays the Evil Queen with a flamboyant and sinister flair. Her performance is marked by imposing body language and movements, effectively conveying the character's malevolence. However, some critics note that her portrayal lacks depth, with her singing and dialogue not fully capturing the character's operatic essence. Despite these critiques, Gadot's embodiment of the Evil Queen adds a campy and unrepentantly evil presence to the film.

"The recent Snow White remake, unfortunately, falls short of capturing the charm and heart of the original Disney classic. While it attempts to modernize the story, the film seems to prioritize contemporary themes over the fundamental aspects that made the original tale so beloved.

One of the main issues with this remake is its shift in focus from Snow White's personal growth and her relationships with the dwarfs to more modern, preachy themes about independence and self-reliance. These themes feel forced and detract from the emotional core of the story. The original Snow White was a symbol of kindness and resilience, and these qualities are less emphasized here, which makes the character feel less relatable and harder to root for.

The portrayal of Snow White in this version is another point of concern. While the actress delivers her performance with determination, the character's warmth and innocence-key to the original-are largely absent. Instead of an endearing figure, Snow White here feels more like a character shaped by modern ideals rather than the timeless virtues that made her stand out in the classic.

Similarly, the Evil Queen, once a complex and menacing villain, is reduced to a less compelling figure. Her motivations feel unclear, and the character lacks the depth and menace that made her such a memorable antagonist in the original film.

The film's attempt to infuse social commentary into the narrative is another area where it struggles. While it's important for films to reflect societal values, the messages in this remake often feel overly forced, detracting from the story rather than enhancing it. It's clear that the intention was to create a more empowering story, but the execution leaves much to be desired.

Visually, the film is polished and colorful, but its flashy aesthetics can't mask the lack of emotional depth. There's a sense that the filmmakers were more concerned with spectacle than with crafting a story that resonates with audiences on a deeper level.

Ultimately, while this Snow White remake offers a fresh take, it doesn't quite live up to the spirit of the original. It prioritizes modern themes over the timeless qualities of the classic story, which may leave long-time fans disappointed.",1/10,recent snow white remake unfortunately falls short capturing charm heart original disney classic attempts modernize story film seems prioritize contemporary themes fundamental aspects made original tale beloved one main issues remake shift focus snow white personal growth relationships dwarfs modern preachy themes independence themes feel forced detract emotional core story original snow white symbol kindness resilience qualities less emphasized makes character feel less relatable harder root portrayal snow white version another point concern actress delivers performance determination character warmth largely absent instead endearing figure snow white feels like character shaped modern ideals rather timeless virtues made stand classic similarly evil queen complex menacing villain reduced less compelling figure motivations feel unclear character lacks depth menace made memorable antagonist original film film attempt infuse social commentary narrative another area struggles important films reflect societal values messages remake often feel overly forced detracting story rather enhancing clear intention create empowering story execution leaves much desired visually film polished colorful flashy aesthetics ca mask lack emotional depth sense filmmakers concerned spectacle crafting story resonates audiences deeper level ultimately snow white remake offers fresh take quite live spirit original prioritizes modern themes timeless qualities classic story may leave fans disappointed,0.937,0.224,0.135,0.641

"I approached the film with low expectations, but what awaited me there undercut even these. This film is not just a failed remake - it is a prime example of how to distort a timeless classic beyond recognition. The magic of the original has been replaced by sterile images, lifeless acting and a plot that is clearly ashamed of its own identity.

Rachel Zegler as Snow White comes across as consistently distant, almost as if she doesn't believe in the story she's telling. Her performance lacks warmth, and any form of charisma is sorely missing. And while her voice has potential, the songs remain pale and forgettable the moment they fade. The musical magic of the original? Gone without a trace.

Gal Gadot, who visually fits the role of the Evil Queen without question, delivers a performance that swings between overacted pathos and emotionless routine. She's neither frightening nor fascinating - just completely out of place. Her scenes feel more like a fashion campaign with dialogue than a film performance.

What shocked me most was the visual execution. Despite the enormous budget, the film looks like an overlong commercial from post-production hell. The CGI depiction of the ""dwarfs"" (if we're even allowed to call them that anymore) is so artificial, I felt secondhand embarrassment. These figures have neither charm nor personality - they are mere digital shadows of once-beloved characters.

But the film's biggest flaw lies in its core attitude: instead of developing the story or respectfully reinterpreting it, it goes out of its way to distance itself from the original - and in doing so, completely loses its emotional core. The romantic component is sacrificed for ideological reasons without offering anything of equal value in return. What remains is a narrative that neither moves nor inspires.

Throughout the entire runtime, I kept asking myself why this film even exists. Anyone who loves the original should avoid this soulless product at all costs.

"Disney's Snow White (2024): A Joyless, Soulless Trainwreck

Disney has done it again-taken a beloved classic and butchered it beyond recognition. The latest Snow White live-action remake is not only a failure as a film but also a complete insult to its source material. It strips away everything that made the original 1937 masterpiece iconic, replacing it with a dull, uninspired, and utterly joyless attempt at a ""modernized"" fairy tale. If you were hoping for a nostalgic retelling with stunning visuals, compelling characters, and heartfelt storytelling, you're in for a massive disappointment.

An Unlikable, Hollow Snow White

Let's start with the biggest problem-Snow White herself. The original Snow White was a kind-hearted, graceful, and gentle character who embodied innocence and optimism. This new version? She's cold, self-righteous, and completely lacking in charm. Instead of being a princess who inspires others with kindness, she is reimagined as a tough, independent leader who seems to look down on the very concept of a fairy tale romance.

Disney clearly wanted to push a ""modern"" version of Snow White, but in doing so, they completely erased what made her an endearing and timeless character. The worst part? The lead actress openly dismissed the original film and its themes in interviews, making it obvious that neither she nor the filmmakers had any respect for the story they were remaking. How are audiences supposed to connect with a character who seems to resent the very movie she's starring in?

Where's the Magic? Where's the Fun?

One of the most tragic aspects of this remake is its complete lack of magic and wonder. The original film was full of whimsy, from the charming dwarfs to the hauntingly beautiful Evil Queen. This version, however, is dull, lifeless, and visually uninspired.

The seven dwarfs, some of the most iconic characters in Disney history, have been all but erased, replaced with a bizarre group of ""magical creatures"" that lack any personality or charm. Their humor, heart, and unique personalities are gone, leaving nothing but generic, forgettable side characters that no one will remember five minutes after the credits roll.

Even the Evil Queen, one of Disney's most iconic villains, has been watered down. Instead of being a terrifying, vain, and manipulative villain, she's just another standard ""jealous queen"" character with no real presence or depth. Her sinister elegance and memorable lines are absent, making her feel like an afterthought rather than the driving force of the story.

A Complete Betrayal of the Classic Story

Disney has taken a timeless fairy tale and stripped it of everything that made it resonate with audiences for nearly a century. The romance? Gone. The dwarfs? Erased. The heartwarming themes of kindness and perseverance? Replaced with forced modern messaging. What remains is a film that feels more like a generic fantasy adventure rather than an actual retelling of Snow White.

The most frustrating part is that this was entirely unnecessary. If Disney wanted to tell a different story, they could have created a brand-new fairy tale rather than butchering a classic. Instead, they decided to slap the Snow White name onto something that has nothing in common with the beloved original.

Final Verdict: A Total Disaster

At this point, Disney's live-action remakes have become predictable disasters, and Snow White is just another casualty. With an unlikable protagonist, a lifeless story, and a complete disregard for the charm of the original, this film is a soulless cash grab with nothing of value to offer.

"The new Snow White adaptation is a disappointing departure from the beloved classic. Stripping away the heart of the original story, it replaces timeless themes of love, resilience, and adventure with a hollow, agenda-driven narrative. The charm and whimsy that made Snow White a fairytale icon are lost in lifeless dialogue and uninspired performances.

"3 out of 5 stars.

Snow White is a fair fantasy musical film based on the original animated film. There is some changes but the magic is missing in this one.

Pros: The plot is good. It's somewhat similar to the original with substituting Prince Charming for Jonathan. Which seemed a bit dull as a character.

Rachel Zegler did great as the role. Her performance and talent is growing and sweet. Gal Gadot as the evil queen was great.

The musical sequences are great. It does hit the high notes with a lot of heart.

Cons

The script felt a little underdeveloped with the characters. Jonathan who is supposed to be Snow Whites love interest was underdeveloped. Making his character dull. The evil queen another underdeveloped character that wastes the talent of Gal Gadot.

The visual effects were a bit of a miss. The dwarves looked like unfinished cgi work. Which was a sad thing. Cause those characters were supposed to be the lovable part of the film. And yet this film makes them forgettable.

Overall, it is an okay film with a great cast but the script is undeveloped in some areas making a lot of characters forgettable. And the visuals were a bit uneven. The musical sequences and casts were great with plenty of entertainment.",6/10,stars snow white fair fantasy musical film based original animated film changes magic missing one pros plot good somewhat similar original substituting prince charming jonathan seemed bit dull character rachel zegler great role performance talent growing sweet gal gadot evil queen great musical sequences great hit high notes lot heart cons script felt little underdeveloped characters jonathan supposed snow whites love interest underdeveloped making character dull evil queen another underdeveloped character wastes talent gal gadot visual effects bit miss dwarves looked like unfinished cgi work sad thing cause characters supposed lovable part film yet film makes forgettable overall okay film great cast script undeveloped areas making lot characters forgettable visuals bit uneven musical sequences casts great plenty entertainment,0.991,0.359,0.121,0.52
"Saw it today with my 7 year old. She can sit through any feature movie. Wish, frozen, tangled..and stay engaged and interested.

For this one she was bored and wanted to leave. I just went along but can say the movie looks ok, but there is no soul. Weird pacing and forced action scenes.

Main actress is almost distracting as she does not match the picture I have of Snow White.

Evil queen steals the show. Which throws a wrench in the story arc, as there is no way she would be jealous of snow whites beauty.

And why are the dwarves cgi? They look out of place in a live action movie.

Some songs and scenes are ok but overall it looks like a direct to video film.

"This refreshed live action version of Snow White still brings in the nostalgia of some the songs and characters we remember from the animated film but modernizes it. While the movie has a bit more adventure it still holds it charm and adorable characters, just like the classic you remember!

The film does a good job of explaining the relationship between the evil Queen and Snow White. As simply touched in the original film, more time is spent on backstory of what happened to Cinderella's parents and the Queen's ability to put up with Snow White...well, until she doesn't.

A reimagining Seven Dwarfs and Snow White's love interest is refreshing. Oh, they even remembered to incorporate Snow White's loving forrest animals who are by her side, just like in the original. What is a nice bonus is they added some action/adventure in the film while empowering Snow White. No longer is Snow White just the victim or a character that needs saving, Snow White becomes the hero of her own story (with the help of others). This new twist is a good way to empower younger audiences while still letting Snow White choose good to conquer evil.

"Snow White (2025) A reimagining of Disney's fairy tale into a live-action version filled with vision and a modern perspective, while firmly retaining the framework of the original Grimm fairy tale.

The storytelling focuses on the development of the main characters, particularly Snow White and the Evil Queen, giving them greater depth than the original. While preserving the romantic and dreamy essence of a fairy tale, it cleverly incorporates elements of power struggles and personal identity.

Rachel Zegler plays Snow White with a beautiful voice and strong performance, portraying a character who embodies both gentleness and resilience.

Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen exudes allure and cruelty, delivering a chilling performance that leaves an impression. However, her role lacks the intensity it deserves, missing the fearfulness and mystique expected from the character.

The visuals are crafted with stunning beauty and imagination, reflecting the essence of a fairy tale. The fantasy world is breathtaking, with vibrant colors and intricate details, especially in the forest scenes and lively animals.

The soundtrack remains a highlight of Disney. The music seamlessly blends classic songs with new melodies, particularly the standout track ""Waiting on a Wish."" The classic ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" is reimagined in a modern, melodious way.

However, the screenplay has noticeable weaknesses. Some parts of the story lack deep emotional pull, and supporting characters are underdeveloped. The seven dwarfs are adorable but have overly limited roles.

The first half of the film captivates with its visuals and emotions, but the second half loses balance with rushed pacing. The ending feels overly simplistic, leaving a sense of disappointment.

Snow White (2025) blends classic elements with contemporary flair and a fresh interpretation in a satisfying way. It may not reach its full potential, but it's a film that both fans of the classic and newer audiences can enjoy.

Score: 9/10 Despite initial negative opinions about Rachel Zegler, after watching the film, I must admit her acting and singing skills are impressive.

"First, let me quote Ansu Kabia's review: >That the audience for **Ari Aster**'s folk horror might find more pleasure in this Snow White than the average child is telling, since it's almost impossible to work out who this version of the story is aimed at. Children will be bored, teens talked down to, and most adults will wonder where their Snow White is.

Exactly. Who is the target audience of this movie, I couldn't discern. Perhaps the so-called theatre kids, but definitely not kids or adults. Here's my full review: * First, ***SUBSTANCE***: The tale of** Snow White** is inherently flawed and lacks substance, and despite going rebellious this version couldn't circumvent those weaknesses let alone translating them for better. Worsening on the other hand, well... * Now, ***VISUALS***? Too vibrant and glistening. The CGI is the biggest enemy in here because it's not disguised properly, and I'm not even going to talk about the catastrophe, that is the thing that happened with little people. The forest, animals, all those wooden houses, kingdom, grass, trees, plant - they are cartoonish, imagine how the special effects looked during ***Lord of the Rings***' era and then increase the saturation and contrast - that bad. It's flabbergasting that they did not go with the darker visuals as seen in the **1937 version** where no flamboyant yellow and green was needed. I take it they wanted to push some kind of ""joy"" based agenda here... I don't know. But the effects don't even match ***Beauty and the Beast*** and that thing came out 8 yrs ago. Maybe, Disney really isn't lying about the budget; maybe the budget really is under $300 million.

* Next ***ACTING***: **Rachel Zegler** can sing alright, and that's the only thing I can find positive to say about her. She's clearly s theater actress and the melodrama shows and gets annoying. That hairstyle isn't helping, and of course, the dress of Snow White makes her appear worse somehow. It's inexplicable, yet conspicuous. **Gal Gadot**, on the other hand, is really not given adequate character. She's an average actress, something we have known all along, but this appearance in here was laughably bad.

* Finally, ***STORY & DIRECTION***: The sloppy themes of leadership are laughable and you can clearly see **Greta Gerwig**'s work there, who was later replaced. Like ***Barbie***, this film go to extreme lengths to reiterate that ***Snow White*** would be a better leader, like Barbies and women in *Barbie*, but like that film it never corroborates that fact by answering ""why would that be?"" We have seen grittier version in ***Snow White and the Huntsman***, and honestly even that was not this bad. The problem is again these visuals and all the musical numbers really not helping.

Lastly, a note to director **Marc Webb**: i love your work in '***The Amazing Spider-Man***' franchise and I loved '***500 Days of Summer***' and I appreciated '***Gifted***,' but you need to stay away from reboots. People weren't happy with *TASM* coming out even though it was a brilliantly darker retelling, but '***Snow White***' just isn't it.

Of course, what's done is done, but let's not remake '***Kimi no Na Wa***.' okay, that thing is too knew for remakes, anyways, and Hollywood's butchery will not sit well there. If you thought this so-called ""right-wing"" backlash was bad, you ain't seen anime fans' fury yet.

So yeah, ***Snow White*** = not worth a watch, hype, or budget; hate and boycott on the other hand... Not sure it's for kids, definitely not for adults.",1/10,first let quote ansu kabia review audience ari aster folk horror might find pleasure snow white average child telling since almost impossible work version story aimed children bored teens talked adults wonder snow white exactly target audience movie could discern perhaps theatre kids definitely kids adults full review first substance tale snow white inherently flawed lacks substance despite going rebellious version could circumvent weaknesses let alone translating better worsening hand well visuals vibrant glistening cgi biggest enemy disguised properly even going talk catastrophe thing happened little people forest animals wooden houses kingdom grass trees plant cartoonish imagine special effects looked lord rings era increase saturation contrast bad flabbergasting go darker visuals seen version flamboyant yellow green needed take wanted push kind joy based agenda know effects even match beauty beast thing came yrs ago maybe disney really lying budget maybe budget really million next acting rachel zegler sing alright thing find positive say clearly theater actress melodrama shows gets annoying hairstyle helping course dress snow white makes appear worse somehow inexplicable yet conspicuous gal gadot hand really given adequate character average actress something known along appearance laughably bad finally story direction sloppy themes leadership laughable clearly see greta gerwig work later replaced like barbie film go extreme lengths reiterate snow white would better leader like barbies women barbie like film never corroborates fact answering would seen grittier version snow white huntsman honestly even bad problem visuals musical numbers really helping lastly note director marc webb love work amazing franchise loved days summer appreciated gifted need stay away reboots people happy tasm coming even though brilliantly darker retelling snow white course done done let remake kimi na wa okay thing knew remakes anyways hollywood butchery sit well thought backlash bad ai seen anime fans fury yet yeah snow white worth watch hype budget hate boycott hand sure kids definitely adults,0.993,0.267,0.14,0.593
"CGI Dwarfs: A Paradox of Technical Showmanship and Emotional Disconnect The film replaces the iconic seven dwarfs with cartoonish CGI-generated figures, a decision widely condemned as a ""grotesque patchwork of cultural industry clichés"" .Worse, the dwarfs' design-trapped in an unsettling ""human-but-not-human"" limbo-erases the endearing whimsy of their animated counterparts. Over-reliance on flashy effects (e.g., ""magic-hour lighting"") further cheapens their presence, rendering them visually artificial. This obsession with technology reflects Disney's fundamental misunderstanding: the dwarfs are not mere fairy-tale tropes but vessels of humanized emotion. CGI's overuse strips them of this vital connection.

Snow White's flaws reflect Disney's recurring sins in live-action remakes: prioritizing technological spectacle and forced modern messaging over storytelling. When the magic mirror struggles to name ""the fairest,"" Disney should ask itself: true magic lies not in CGI dazzle but in reigniting the pure emotional resonance of fairy tales.

And the plot twists! Who knew you could stretch a fairy tale into a convoluted mess that leaves you longing for a good old-fashioned nap? The dialogue is a masterpiece of banality, perfect for anyone who enjoys conversations as riveting as paint drying.

"This movie looks haphazardly thrown together, almost as though they tried to mash three different films shot in three different ways together (which they probably did with all the reshoots).

"Contrary to all opinions here, I really liked the movie.. I expected the worst and in the end I was pleasantly surprised, Gal Gadot stepped into the role and gave the goods, her song was catchy and I found myself humming the song after the movie.

"Disney's live-action Snow White is a disastrous misstep, failing on nearly every front. The film's attempt to modernize the classic story results in a muddled and uninspired narrative, with changes that feel forced rather than meaningful. Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the charm and warmth of the original, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen delivers an underwhelming and wooden performance.

Visually, the film is equally disappointing. The CGI dwarfs are unsettling, the overuse of digital effects makes everything feel artificial, and the production design lacks the magical quality that made the animated version timeless. The musical numbers, including the new songs, are forgettable and lifeless, failing to capture the spirit of the original score.

Gal Gadot gave a great performance, in all aspects. Rachel Zegler used her innocence, beauty and voice to embody a hero we can all love. Andrew Burnap was Robin Hood-esque in heroism and charm.

"I just watched Disney's latest live-action remake of Snow White, and honestly, it was a huge letdown. As someone who grew up loving the original animated classic, I went in hoping for at least a visually stunning and heartfelt adaptation, but what I got was a bland, uninspired mess that completely missed the magic of the original.

A Snow White That Doesn't Feel Like Snow White Right from the start, the film felt... off. The casting of Rachel Zegler as Snow White was controversial for many reasons, but for me, it wasn't just about appearances. She lacked the charm, innocence, and warmth that made the original Snow White so beloved.

"Rachel Zegler is one of the great up-and-coming (if not in some aspects ""already arrived"") song-and-dance-picture stars. Her casting as live-action Snow White is as savvy as Emma Watson's Belle in the similar Beauty and the Beast. Unfortunately, Zegler's talent and charm is about all Snow White has going for it, as it runs into all the same problems as so many of the Disney live-action remakes before it.

For a very basic overview, Snow White tells the iconic tale of the titular princess (Zegler) who is pursued by her evil Queen stepmother (Gal Gadot) and finds refuge both with the enigmatic Seven Dwarves and a rebel named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap).

Again: Zegler is a true standout here. The top moments of this movie are her reprising Whistle While You Work and contributing the original song Princess Problems. In those moments, one can understand why this project was greenlit-because they contain some charm.

Alas, Snow White suffers-like the long line of recent Disney animation remakes before it-from the ""why is this necessary?"" and the ""balance between new/old"" problems. The 1937 original ushered in Disney's reign of animation/musical dominance and this one obviously can't hold a candle to that in scope/spectre. So, director Marc Webb tries to infuse some new material-only to have it be an odd mix trying to weave it in with the classic bits.

Of course, Disney's own petty political panderings hurt this production too. Casting real actors as the Seven Dwarves would have made this a more fun/unique experience-but the Mouse House got rattled by a ridiculous ""dwarfism"" controversy and instead went with dwarf-animation. An asinine choice considering the '37 animation in that department is one of Disney's most iconic properties.

So, overall, I view 2025's Snow White as a great resume-builder for Rachel Zegler-and that's about it. This is a movie absolutely screaming to be liked (who doesn't enjoy a magical fairy tale?!) and only Zegler provides a few of those moments.

On the other hand, Snow White herself delivers a commendable performance. Zegler brings warmth and charm to the character, effectively embodying the innocence and kindness that define her. However, despite her strong acting, the script fails to provide her with meaningful dialogue or character development.

"Disney's 2025 Snow White is a dull and unnecessary remake that fails to capture the magic of the original. The story feels clunky and hollow, stripping away the charm that made the classic so beloved. The visuals and set designs lack creativity, making the world feel uninspired.

"Snow White remake set out to modernize the classic fairy tale, but it ultimately leaves audiences disappointed. The film fails to stay true to the original story while also struggling to establish its own identity.

First and foremost, the lifeless script is a major issue. The characters lack depth, the dialogues feel artificial, and there's no emotional connection with the audience. Key elements of the fairy tale have been altered, but rather than making the story more engaging, these changes strip it of its essence.

The performances aren't particularly impressive either. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks charisma and inspiration, making the character feel ordinary and at times even unlikable. Additionally, the characters replacing the seven dwarfs are weakly designed and serve no meaningful purpose in the story.

When it comes to visuals and production quality, the film is shockingly mediocre for a Disney production. The CGI looks cheap, backgrounds feel artificial, and instead of creating a magical atmosphere, the movie ends up looking dull and uninspired.",1/10,snow white remake set modernize classic fairy tale ultimately leaves audiences disappointed film fails stay true original story also struggling establish identity first foremost lifeless script major issue characters lack depth dialogues feel artificial emotional connection audience key elements fairy tale altered rather making story engaging changes strip essence performances particularly impressive either rachel zegler portrayal snow white lacks charisma inspiration making character feel ordinary times even unlikable additionally characters replacing seven dwarfs weakly designed serve meaningful purpose story comes visuals production quality film shockingly mediocre disney production cgi looks cheap backgrounds feel artificial instead creating magical atmosphere movie ends looking dull uninspired,0.3384,0.162,0.144,0.694

This movie in no way holds up any of the standards Disney has committed to in the past.

This does not even begin to resemble a true Disney film from this era or the past. If it is the future of Disney then the entire studio is dead.

Storyline, acting, editing and even the lighting was inconsistent and distracting.

For the amount of time it took to get the picture made and edited, one would think there would have been plenty of time to focus group this production and make changes to make it somewhat entertaining.

Sitting through the entire production felt as if the producers were trying to make us like their new vision of filmmaking.

Afterwards discussed it and tried to decided it maybe it was the Wizard of Oz effect. Over the present audiences' head, and later a classic. In no way could this be true.

"Gal Gadot's as of the Evil Queen in Snow White is, unfortunately, a major misstep. Her performance falls flat in almost every other aspect. Her line delivery lacks the depth and menace needed for such an iconic role, making her character feel more like a cartoonish exaggeration than a truly intimidating force.

One of the biggest issues with Gadot's acting is her emotional range-or lack thereof. Rather than bringing a nuanced, layered villain to life, her performance comes across as forced and unnatural. Instead of exuding an effortless aura of wickedness, her delivery feels stiff and overly rehearsed. The Evil Queen should command the screen with a chilling presence, but Gadot's portrayal feels more like a parody, as if she's trying too hard to be menacing without actually achieving it.

Another glaring flaw is how she handles the dialogue.",1/10,gal gadot evil queen snow white unfortunately major misstep performance falls flat almost every aspect line delivery lacks depth menace needed iconic role making character feel like cartoonish exaggeration truly intimidating force one biggest issues gadot acting emotional lack thereof rather bringing nuanced layered villain life performance comes across forced unnatural instead exuding effortless aura wickedness delivery feels stiff overly rehearsed evil queen command screen chilling presence gadot portrayal feels like parody trying hard menacing without actually achieving another glaring flaw handles dialogue,-0.9694,0.087,0.291,0.622

There's been so much controversy over this movie in the past few months and I'll say this, casting Rachel Zegler as Snow White was not the biggest problem in this. No, there's loads of them.

The story itself has changed, the CGI Dwarfs look terrible, Gal Gadot is beyond hot and somehow Rachel Zegler is supposed to be prettier? The idea of the seven members of the thief's party might have originally been supposed to be stand ins for the Seven Dwarfs... oh sorry ""magical creatures"". And what's their magic?

It is missing that Disney Magic, when a film grabs your body and soul, only to become so entwined with the very essence of the film. This doesn't have it, which is sad because Snow White is a wonderful fairy tale.

"Few -- if any -- films have experienced the pre-release analysis and criticism Snow White has endured. Those of us who have chosen to await the final cut's release have met with pretty much what was anticipated in the extensive earlier discussion.

One positive note comes in the performance of Gal Gadot (which saves the musical from a one star rating). She is excellent as the evil step mother lusting to preserve her rule. Some may criticize her performance as lacking ""range,"" but that is the nature of this archetype.

"Who thought having this woman play a part in this movie was a good idea.

Disney's decision to cast Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen in the Snow White remake is a complete misstep. The role demands a truly commanding and sinister presence-someone who can embody the Queen's ruthless obsession with beauty and power. Instead, they chose an actress whose performances often feel flat and unconvincing, lacking the depth needed for such an iconic villain.

The Evil Queen is supposed to be chilling, her mere presence sending shivers down the audience's spine. Yet, with this casting, it's hard to imagine anything other than a bland and uninspired portrayal. Her delivery lacks the dramatic weight necessary to make the Queen a truly memorable antagonist. This choice feels lazy, as if Disney simply prioritized star power over actually finding someone who fits the role.

On top of that, her voice alone is a huge issue. The Evil Queen's voice should be commanding and filled with authority, yet here, it will likely feel weak and unthreatening. This role deserved someone with theatrical gravitas, not someone who struggles to bring depth to their performances.

"Of all the Disney animated classics, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" might just be the least necessary one to remake. It's the most iconic, yet ironically, the one with the weakest emotional connection to modern audiences.

The original 1937 animated film is so old that most people either don't remember the actual plot or have never bothered to watch it at all. For most, ""Snow White"" lives on as vague cultural shorthand - a poisoned apple, a magic mirror, ""Hi Ho,"" and that's about it. Unlike the Disney Renaissance films (Aladdin, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast), which still have songs people sing in the shower, ""Snow White's"" music barely registers anymore. It's a relic.

Another reason this remake felt unnecessary is Disney's self-imposed creative straitjacket. When Disney remakes ""Snow White"", they're not reimagining the classic fairy tale. They're remaking ""their own version"" of the story.

This gives Disney a competitive advantage but also creates a significant handicap. The advantage? Disney's animated ""Snow White"" is so culturally dominant that people often mistakenly think they invented the tale. This monopoly on the cultural memory of ""Snow White"" gives Disney an unparalleled level of brand loyalty - other studios can release ""their"" versions of ""Snow White"", but they'll just feel like ""yet another ""Snow White"" movie."" When Disney does it, it's ""The"" ""Snow White"" movie. It's an event. You don't want to ignore it.

The disadvantage? Disney can't stray too far from their original animated film. They ""have"" to keep the look and feel of their version intact to preserve their cultural dominance. Reinventing the wheel would risk alienating fans who expect the movie to ""feel like Disney."" So instead of daring, bold reimaginings like ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" (a horror take), ""Mirror Mirror"" (a campy comedy), or ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (dark action fantasy), Disney gives us a watered-down rehash that feels as bland as it is redundant.

It's clear Disney believed that the only way to turn ""Snow White"" into another billion-dollar juggernaut was to stick to the formula. After all, it worked for ""The Lion King"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Aladdin"". Why mess with success? Those previous remakes were soulless cash grabs too, but they made money, so Disney stuck to the plan.

Unfortunately, they didn't anticipate that their one bold casting choice - the decision to feature a Latina actress as Snow White - would blow up so spectacularly in their faces.

Disney's live-action strategy relies heavily on nostalgia, but it's nostalgia dressed up in shiny packaging. The studio markets these movies as comforting throwbacks with just enough tweaks to feel ""fresh."" But in reality, these tweaks are often superficial, half-hearted, and inconsistent. ""Snow White"" is no exception.

The film is filled with Disney's usual sins: slavish devotion to the animated original (to the point of absurdity), awkward attempts to modernize certain aspects of the story, and an overall lack of creativity. The result is a movie that feels like it's trying to justify its own existence and failing miserably.

Take the visuals, for instance. Disney insists on preserving the look of the original film, but without any thought as to ""Why"" these design choices made sense in the first place. The costumes and set design feel less like ""classic fairy tale"" and more like ""theme park cosplay."" By comparison, ""Mirror Mirror's"" whimsical costumes fit the film's comedic tone, and ""Snow White and the Huntsman's"" gritty aesthetic matched its dark, action-packed vibe. Disney's live-action ""Snow White"", on the other hand, feels like it only exists to sell merchandise.

The story fares no better. Disney knows it needs to flesh out the characters and make their relationships more believable, but it never fully commits to these changes. For example, the Evil Queen's jealousy of Snow White is still mostly about beauty, with only a vague suggestion of political ambition. Meanwhile, the Huntsman's moral dilemma about killing Snow White is staged so awkwardly that it feels like a bad high school play. The actors do their best, but the scene is so stilted and out of place that it's almost painful to watch.

Perhaps the most glaring issue is the Evil Queen herself. Gal Gadot is, without question, the worst Evil Queen in cinematic history. And no, I'm not exaggerating. Let's be real: the only reason she was cast is because of her looks. Sure, she's gorgeous, but when you're following in the footsteps of Sigourney Weaver (Snow White: A Tale of Terror), Julia Roberts (Mirror Mirror), and Charlize Theron (Snow White and the Huntsman), looking pretty isn't enough. Those actresses brought elegance, menace, and depth to the role. Gadot? She brought... eyebrow wiggling and ""constipated villain face."" Every time she tried to emote, I felt secondhand embarrassment. Her singing? Let's just say it sounded so autotuned, I wasn't sure if it was even her voice.

To be fair, this is probably her least embarrassing performance since ""Wonder Woman 1984"". At least she managed to hit the basic beats of ""scheming and evil,"" even if it felt like she'd just learned the concept from an acting coach five minutes before filming. But honestly, Disney could've thrown a dart at a list of actresses, and anyone it hit would've been better than Gadot.

On the flip side, Rachel Zegler - the controversial choice for Snow White - is the film's one saving grace. Hate her all you want, but the girl can act, sing, and dance circles around anyone else in this movie. Her performance is effortlessly charismatic, with a radiant charm that lights up every scene she's in. You can criticize her all you want on Twitter, but her talent is undeniable. There's a reason industry legends like Rita Moreno have called her a ""triple threat"" - she's the real deal.

Zegler's musical numbers in this film are mesmerizing. She knows how to act through a song, weaving emotion into every note and gesture. Even her much-mocked expressions during ""Waiting on a Wish"" (yes, I've seen the memes) are a masterclass in theatricality. If you went into this movie determined to hate her, that's on you. But if you're willing to set aside the internet hate train for a moment, you might actually see why she's one of the most exciting young talents in Hollywood.

At the end of the day, Disney's live-action ""Snow White"" is exactly what you'd expect: a mediocre cash grab with a few fleeting moments of brilliance (courtesy of Zegler). It's not the worst thing Disney's ever made, but it's certainly not worth the hype. For me, it's just another soulless remake that exists more to sell toys than to tell a compelling story.

"Three stars solely for Gal Gadot. She is stunning and does the Disney-baddie acting perfectly: corny lines, dance number and all.

The casting of Snow White is a disaster. Rather than tall, fair, graceful and beautiful we get this person that is really bland. Not too be mean but she is just clearly not suitable for the role.

The feigned warmth just comes across as annoying and tedious. And of course the romance is gone - replace by some idea that Snow White is to be a leader of the kingdom and queen.

"The original Snow White is a perfect and timeless movie. It is still enjoyable and funny even now.

This remake is terrible. Everything is obviously fake and there is nothing magical about Snow White talking to bad CGI dwarves and animals. The changes to the story were cliche and weak.

Some strong points were when the wicked queen appeared as an old hag to give Snow White the poison apple and she fell and the apple rolled from her hand. That is a direct scene from the original. The ""hag"" and apple were great and the fall was great photography. But again, why is it needed? We don't need to recreate something in attempt to match it's cinematic perfection from earlier.

"I watched Snow White (2025) at InOrbit's PVR Mx4D, and the experience was nothing short of transportive. The moment the story began to unfold, it wasn't just a cinematic journey-it was an emotional return to my first-grade days at Holy Name High School, Colaba, where fairy tales felt as real as the sea breeze outside our classroom windows.

Directed by Marc Webb and written by Erin Cressida Wilson, Greta Gerwig, and Dorothy Ann Blank, this live-action Disney adaptation stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White, Gal Gadot as the sinister yet mesmerizing Evil Queen, and Andrew Burnap in a supporting role. The film gives the 1937 animated classic a fresh, musical spin-with a Latina Snow White leading the way through a forest of magic, menace, and self-discovery.

Interestingly, as I watched the film in full Mx4D immersion, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was watching a fusion of three classic fairy tales: Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Little Red Riding Hood. Perhaps it was the enchanted slumber, the dark and mysterious forest, or the deceptive appearances of danger wrapped in beauty-it all felt like a richly woven fairy-tale tapestry, where the innocence of youth meets the lurking shadows of fear and fate.

The visual effects were enchanting, the Mx4D effects-from the whooshing forest winds to the jolts of surprise-made every magical moment feel tangible. The performances were sincere, with Zegler bringing a quiet strength to Snow White, and Gal Gadot channeling icy elegance as the Evil Queen.

Though the film is tracking a modest box office opening ($45-55 million), it shines as a heartfelt reimagining that brings Disney's classic to a new generation-with fresh faces, diverse voices, and a modern undercurrent of empowerment.

In the end, it wasn't just a fantasy on screen-it was a mirror into the fairy tales that shaped our childhood imaginations, now retold with emotional depth and dazzling artistry.

"LIKES: Animation For Animals Costume/Makeup Some Dialogue Well-Written/Delivered Some Good Emotional Moments Musical Level Songs Cute/Cuddly/Disney Modern Voice Acting Is Good For Me Solid Messages.

Summary: Despite the masses calling for the head of Snow White, I found a few things I think were done well in this film. We start with the voice acting and the cast that brings it to life when it comes to the dwarves and the magic mirror. Though not as strong as the original seven, I liked the new group very much and found their techniques quite fitting for the live-action make. They embody the personalities well and add that fantasy element Disney is very efficient at making but still holds more emotion than much of the non-digital cast. These guys are the ones who deliver some of the better dialogue, a few of the live-action cast managed to drop some really powerful lines at just the right moment that will make it on the quote boards. I found those quotes often in those very heartfelt moments where everything came together, some inflections of the Disney magic sparkling the way they did in the 1900s and delivering those solid messages of kindness, fairness, and hard work to solve problems.

Where most of the splendor came for me in the movie is the visual effects that capture that Disney cuddliness we know the company for holding. The costumes and makeup are solid rebuilds of the cartoon design, many of them authentic nods to the times but pop with a bit of modern sheen for future cosplays. Sure, some of the costumes look a little cheaper than others, but overall, it is a better portrayal of the character than other facets. I enjoyed the songs to some degree, with a very Broadway musical ambiance radiating from them as Snow sings her way through the opening numbers and dances about with the town in new songs that Disney continues to spin out. The older numbers are very fun as well, not quite as Mystical Melody as in the past, but still holding that fun charm that I remember from the film, but could have used some more finesse and planning to be memorable. Finally, the animation for the animals was something I found to be my favorite aspect of this movie. Like Enchanted, Snow White's live adaptation puts a lot of gorgeous detail into the animals, keeping much of their physiology with just a touch of the human element to add that adorable energy to give them their own tertiary personalities. They play a rather large part in the movie, and it helps add Disney family-friendly charm for the younger audience members that modern Disney continues to keep in their films and should be enjoyable to the masses.

DISLIKES Plot Is Messy Too Many Characters CGI Design Is Meh for Most Wasted Wicked Queen Boring/Lacking Stakes The Dance Numbers Are All The Same Unnecessary Musicals Lacking Full Punch Conflicting Story Arcs Predictable/Tries Too Hard One Of The Weakest Climactic Endings A Victim of Edits and Media Summary: That's where the likes end, unfortunately. Snow White's live remake comes with several dislikes that I feel are going to be ill-received by audiences, given what I saw. One of the biggest weaknesses for me was the new plot. Sure, the origin of her name is a bit eye-rolling, but Snow White's new tale is trying to be too many things at once and do too many arcs in a compressed time. Snow White's desire to get outside the castle is not such a simple tale as we are introduced to bandits, dwarves, more of huntsmen, evil queens, and new desires for the protagonist. The film is loaded with way too many characters, and I don't really have time to learn most of their names or stories before jumping back into another facet of this movie. The writers struggled to pick lanes and stay in them, and their plot intertwining is very messy and knotted up with frayed transitions. I found it difficult to get tied to any of the characters, none of them packing that same punch outside a few moments nor as well-layered as I know Disney can do. Even the Wicked Queen is very wasted, an antagonist with such potential drowned out by awkward plots and too many arcs competing for dominance. Yet, the worst thing is Snow White's character is too spread thin between the different ""princesses"" she has to be. This new age of remaking the character but keeping to the classic got out of hand, Zegler doing her best to play so many approaches not enough to make this a very inconsistent Snow White I didn't love or hate. When you see that a lot of the live-character actors didn't have the best acting consistency, it only further weakens the strained characters for viewers like me and makes the film boring.

Surely, the spectacle is enough to make up for it, right? I'm sorry to say the answer is no on that one. The dance numbers are charming at times, that musical prowess present in the resonating voices, thundering instruments, and grandiose extensions of notes. However, many of the songs feel very much the same, with reprises and similar-sounding tunes that lack the variety I know Disney to have past their earlier works. The dance numbers also felt very carbon-copy, the same twirls, exchanges, and steps feeling lazy and repetitive shots that pale in comparison to shows like Wicked do so well. Even worse, the movie felt very carefree, where they inserted songs, with many of them feeling shoehorned in to get another track on the playlist. Such haphazard planning doesn't do much for me, especially when each track feels very much the same song. As for the action, this is another Snow White tale that struggles to do much with the action scenes or climatic struggles. This remake makes a show for building up drama, adding suspense with potentially losing characters at any moment before changing their mind. It's a rather safe film, with more marching and shadow work than actual action, making this feel like the second season of House of Dragons. While this is good news for parents who think any conflict is too violent, for those who like more meat to their story, you'll be subjected to some of the most anticlimactic resolutions to the story. A great theme to stick with regarding the messages, but as a spectacle, it is kind of dull in the grand scheme of Disney movies. All of these problems, I think, are due to the media coverage and the edits that came from it taking the changes too far to make a cohesive film.

The VERDICT: I can see the potential of Snow White and some of the modern elements that could have worked. Disney continues to make good visuals and world-crafting tricks, supplies Broadway-like bellows in their tracks, good voice acting for some lines, and plenty of the new cute and cuddly magic that Disney has played well with their stories. That component will make this movie enjoyable for many families to see, especially those with younger children. However, in terms of a cohesive piece, this live-action fails on many levels with its approach to trying too many things in one film. The conflicting nature of Snow White between classic and new was not fun, nor was trying to juggle many characters who weren't necessary and could have spent more time with the dwarves. Much of the acting could do little to save bland characters who had little time to enjoy, and I was bored with the predictable and anticlimactic tales that couldn't get away from the messages. Throw in repetitive song and dance numbers, and you leave me little of that fantastic factor Disney's 2-D animation was known for having. Thus, is this movie a necessity for theater viewing? I don't think it is outside of a field trip or group outing, with your time much better spent watching at home. When I factor in everything, I give Snow White:

"I went into the new Snow White movie hoping for a fresh take on the classic story, but instead, I got a masterclass in wooden acting courtesy of Gal Gadot. As the evil queen, she delivers her lines with all the menace of a mildly annoyed tik toker. Every scene she's in feels like a forced, over-rehearsed monologue rather than a genuine performance. Her facial expressions barely change, her delivery is flat, and her attempts at being intimidating are laughable.

The Evil Queen should be a figure of terrifying elegance, someone who commands the screen with every glance. Instead, Gadot just... stands there, posing like she's still in a perfume commercial.

"This film is a textbook example of how NOT to do a remake. It takes everything that made the original beloved and replaces it with a lifeless, uninspired mess.

First, let's talk about the lead performance-bland, emotionless, and utterly forgettable. The actress playing Snow White lacks the charm, warmth, and charisma needed for the role. Instead of a strong and endearing heroine, we get a character who feels detached from the world around her.

The CGI? A nightmare. The creatures and backgrounds look artificial, like something from a cheap video game. The dwarfs (or lack thereof) are a complete misfire, removing one of the most iconic elements of the original. Instead, we get a bizarre, soulless attempt at modernizing the story that just falls flat.

And let's not forget the script-awkward, preachy, and devoid of any real heart. Instead of capturing the whimsy and timelessness of the original, the movie hammers audiences with heavy-handed messaging that feels more like a lecture than a fairy tale. The villain? Uninspired. The songs? Unmemorable. The pacing? An absolute slog.

"SuckSnow White is one of the most overrated Disney movies ever made. The plot is painfully predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the pacing is sluggish. Snow White herself is frustratingly naive, spending most of the film either singing to animals or waiting for a prince to save her. The Evil Queen, while visually striking, has a weak motivation-why does she even need a magic mirror to tell her she's not the fairest? Get a grip!

"Gal Gadot's performance is an unmitigated disaster, turning a beloved fairy tale character into a wooden and utterly charmless figure. Every line she delivers is so stilted and awkward, it's as if she's reading from a teleprompter for the first time. Her attempt at conveying emotion is so forced, viewers might find more depth in a cardboard cutout. This performance not only strips all the enchantment and vitality from Snow White, but it's a painful reminder that star power alone can't inject life into a fundamentally flawed script.

"The film intended to adapt Snow White to more contemporary times, and it wasn't easy given that the animated film tells the story in a traditional way. There was no way to recreate it that would change this because the traditional style used is part of the animated film's identity. The choice was to be a loose adaptation of the Brothers Grimm tale, using elements from the animated film. The film has identifiable elements from the animated version, but a more distinct story that doesn't depend on the animated film. It's a much more independent story, but it maintains some very important aspects of the original tale.

Rachel stumbles at times, but her acting and singing are admirable. Because Snow White's name has always been linked to the character's appearance, redesigning the character wasn't going to be easy. Throughout the adaptations, the character has been fairly respected, with actresses who sometimes conformed to Snow White's beauty standard. Likewise, redesigning Snow White wasn't impossible, either her name or the meaning of her given name could have been changed. Here, they did the latter by linking Snow White's name to the time of her birth during the snowy season. In the 1997 adaptation, Snow White decided to summon courage and confront her stepmother. It was here that Snow White would evolve in subsequent adaptations, becoming a more heroic girl. In ""Mirror Mirror"" and ""Snow White & The Huntsman,"" we see this princess becoming a warrior to confront the queen and free her kingdom from tyranny. This 2024 adaptation follows the same formula, and unlike what audiences have said, here Snow White is driven by honor and concern for her people, just like in the adaptations exemplified above.

Something that has always been essential to the character's core is kindness and gentleness. This has been present in many of the different versions of Snow White, and her pure heart is what has always characterized her. This is also present in this film because Snow White cares for her people and the people around her. Here, Snow White resorts to more stoicism and is a force that acts more through the spirit than the body itself. Beyond giving new meaning to the name, the film does the same with the concept of beauty. When the mirror says that Snow White is the fairest, it doesn't refer to her look, but to the purity of her heart.

Gal Gadot plays Queen Grimhilde, who is serious most of the time and sometimes overacts, but maintains the character's characteristic jealousy and coldness. It may have left something to be desired, but it's a version that, in terms of design and personality, closely resembles the image Grimhilde has had since Disney's animated version. Although the film doesn't explicitly show it, it's easy to see that Grimhilde is overly obsessed with being the only beautiful woman in the entire kingdom. Something that has been present in many adaptations.

The seven dwarfs were redesigned as gnomes, partially respecting the look and personality of their animated counterparts. The downside is that the CGI gave them a somewhat bizarre appearance that could have been corrected with better rendering. Here, the prince was reimagined as a Robin Hood-style bandit named Jonathan. Although he is a somewhat careless man, he plays a role as Snow White's companion and future lover. Jonathan is a noble man who believes in justice and a rebel with ideas that are very compatible with Snow White's. The two make a good duo and have a chemistry that makes love blossom between them.

After all this, it's a very well-functioning adaptation and a stunning fantasy film. Regardless, the animated film remained difficult to dethrone, but this version of Snow White is a good and satisfying film. My final rating for this film is 9/10.",9/10,film intended adapt snow white contemporary times easy given animated film tells story traditional way way recreate would change traditional style used part animated film identity choice loose adaptation brothers grimm tale using elements animated film film identifiable elements animated version distinct story depend animated film much independent story maintains important aspects original tale rachel stumbles times acting singing admirable snow white name always linked character appearance redesigning character going easy throughout adaptations character fairly respected actresses sometimes conformed snow white beauty standard likewise redesigning snow white impossible either name meaning given name could changed latter linking snow white name time birth snowy season adaptation snow white decided summon courage confront stepmother snow white would evolve subsequent adaptations becoming heroic girl mirror mirror snow white huntsman see princess becoming warrior confront queen free kingdom tyranny adaptation follows formula unlike audiences said snow white driven honor concern people like adaptations exemplified something always essential character core kindness gentleness present many different versions snow white pure heart always characterized also present film snow white cares people people around snow white resorts stoicism force acts spirit body beyond giving new meaning name film concept beauty mirror says snow white fairest refer look purity heart gal gadot plays queen grimhilde serious time sometimes overacts maintains character characteristic jealousy coldness may left something desired version terms design personality closely resembles image grimhilde since disney animated version although film explicitly show easy see grimhilde overly obsessed beautiful woman entire kingdom something present many adaptations seven dwarfs redesigned gnomes partially respecting look personality animated counterparts downside cgi gave somewhat bizarre appearance could corrected better rendering prince reimagined robin bandit named jonathan although somewhat careless man plays role snow white companion future lover jonathan noble man believes justice rebel ideas compatible snow white two make good duo chemistry makes love blossom adaptation stunning fantasy film regardless animated film remained difficult dethrone version snow white good satisfying film final rating film,0.9973,0.24,0.054,0.706

"Disney's live-action Snow White is honestly such a letdown. It feels like they took everything magical about the original and swapped it out for boring CGI and a story that tries way too hard to be modern. The cast is great on paper, but even Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot couldn't save it from feeling flat and lifeless. In fact, Rachel's performance somehow managed to drag the whole thing down even further - she just doesn't capture the charm or likability the character deserves.

"I had low expectations, but somehow, the new Snow White managed to disappoint even more than I imagined. The biggest problem? The main actress. Her performance was completely lifeless, lacking any of the charm, warmth, or grace that made the original Snow White an iconic character. Instead of a kind and whimsical princess, we get a flat, uninspired portrayal that feels more like someone begrudgingly reading lines than actually acting.

Beyond that, she seems completely miscast-there's no sense of wonder, no emotional depth, and certainly no chemistry with the rest of the cast. It's as if she was actively trying to distance herself from the role rather than embracing it. The lack of respect for the source material only makes it worse.

"This movie had some of the worst CGI and acting I have ever witnessed. The visual effects looked like they were pulled straight from a low-budget video game from the early 2000s-characters floated awkwardly, green screen edges were painfully obvious, and every scene felt like a rushed mess of pixelated nonsense. As for the acting, I've seen more emotion in a cardboard cutout. The delivery was lifeless, the dialogue sounded forced, and not a single character felt believable. It's almost impressive how bad it was. Every scene felt like an unintentional parody. Avoid this disaster at all costs. I wouldn't recommend this even as a ""so bad it's good"" movie.

"Disney's new ""Snow White"" is a lackluster remake that saps the vibrancy from the beloved classic. Rachel Zegler's Snow White feels one-dimensional, her powerful voice squandered on forgettable tunes like ""Waiting on a Wish,"" which lack the heart of the original soundtrack. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is oddly subdued, delivering a stiff performance that fails to capture the character's iconic menace. The CGI dwarfs are a jarring misstep-creepy rather than charming-while the plot staggers under clunky, modern revisions that clash with the fairy-tale essence.

"Disney's live-action remake of ""Snow White"" has been met with widespread criticism, with many labeling it a significant misstep for the studio. Critics have pointed to a muddled storyline, lackluster performances, and controversial deviations from the original 1937 animated classic. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as ""exhaustingly awful,"" criticizing its ""tiresome pseudo-progressive additions"" and calling the performances of Rachel Zegler (Snow White) and Gal Gadot (the Evil Queen) ""the dullest of their lives."" The film's visual choices have also been a point of contention. The use of photorealistic CGI for the seven dwarfs and woodland creatures has been described as unsettling, with some viewers referring to them as ""nightmare fuel.",1/10,disney remake snow white met widespread criticism many labeling significant misstep studio critics pointed muddled storyline lackluster performances controversial deviations original animated classic peter bradshaw guardian described film exhaustingly awful criticizing tiresome additions calling performances rachel zegler snow white gal gadot evil queen dullest lives film visual choices also point contention use photorealistic cgi seven dwarfs woodland creatures described unsettling viewers referring nightmare fuel,-0.9371,0.052,0.248,0.7

"It was a generally inoffensive but unnecessary remake. The controversies were overstated (making Zegler and her hot takes the most likely culprit in the film's poor numbers). One thing I'm pretty over is the weird direction that all of Disney's songwriting had taken. Some stuff is pretty good (it's all ""technically"" good), but there seems to be a straight line through Jasmine's new song in the Aladdin remake and all the ""girl I'm supposed to be"" songs of pretty much every Disney movie for the last 5-10 years. Disney music just isn't great anymore. I guess I'm in the minority, but I don't LIKE Lin Manuel Miranda's songwriting (I know he didn't write these, but his tone has infected everything). It's well done. And I don't like it. And that's how I feel about everything Disney is doing these days. For something to be basically well done and not be likeable seems to be an issue of tone, of trying to appeal to all the wrong instincts while abandoning some of the hallmarks of good storytelling. It's like they're making movies by committee, but the people on the committee don't like movies. Snow White (the movie) was more wholesome than I expected, but the climax wasn't climactic. It was...meh. Almost silly. There just seems to be a cultural influence through Disney lately that runs counter to the lives of the average movie goer, like they don't speak our language anymore. They're speaking over the heads of the public like they're being idealistic, but with ideals that we don't seem to share. Snow White was the least offensive in this regard of any Disney movies of late, but it still feels like something is getting lost in translation, like they're trying to say what they think we want to hear and they still don't understand it. If anything, it feels like the people who work at Disney and make their movies didn't grow up watching Disney movies.

"I love Disney films, I don't mind the re-branded ones, but they always come out as slightly hollow, and lacking the charm and sense of wonder, which definitely blunders any chances of real success, wonder and even an Imaginary world. Now what Snow White fails to also deliver on the success of the original, this movie was really not that bad though, it did have it's wonderous charm, and a world and nice props and effects, artificial or not, it was lovely and colourful, and the effects for me gave it that spark, that image, that essence of life. Which lacks in many re-makes from the classical tales.

Zeglar, let's start with her. We'll the material wasn't much, but God damn can she act. She can sing, and as Snow White she put on a show for us, she excells in the role, she looks absolutely beutiful in that dress of hers, and whilst the songs weren't as catchy as the original, and the darker tone of the story, her music gave it a real breath of fresh air. And she was amazing in the role, her charm, charisma and notes makes her fun to watch on screen, as she was really something in that role.

Gadot-her role as the evil sorcerer was fine, nothing noteworthy and nothing that tops-the-scales. More or less just sort of their, and doing an alright job, not that awful. Her songs weren't all that cathcy, and the anti-climax was hollow and rushed through, but her performance was mered by her muffling at times, which would distract the audience.

The 7 Dwarfs-Actually, they look Hillarious, the dwarfs lit-up the show with some jokes, Narratives of people and other things. And motives, memories. And the dwarfs lit it light, they were the best part about the film, as when they were on their was magic, their was a sense of freedom, and they were all great to see on screen. Even if they did look like they were on a video game, which was videoooo cool, instead of just cool. Yes, they look absolutely Rediculous, I couldn't stop laughing.

The bad bits would be the longer duration, the props being like a stage play, but this movie really isn't 2.1 BAD, nope more better then you'd expect. The crashing and burning probably is the controversial things which could of been left out. Because the films biggest problem is the fact that it's sometimes too dark for kids, I Don't think the movie really knew it's audience, I'd say ages 10 and Upwards will heavily enjoy or be gutted with it's outcome, but no-way expressively bad.

"Snow White is a Disney film directed by Marc Webb. I was already at low expectations before I even saw this movie, I tried giving it a chance when I went in theaters. But it still wasn't good. I appreciate the work out into it and I liked the people who were involved in it. The cinematography was excellent and the music was well produced by Benj Pasek & Justin Noble Paul, and the CGI was EXCELLENT! But the story however felt bland and boring, and it some parts felt like they didn't even try. The close-up shots in certain parts of the movie was awkward, and the some of the acting was a bit off. And it still goes to show that sometimes live action isn't better because it will never capture the same feeling as the original. Another problem was that the CGI for the animals felt too cartoony, and I honestly wasn't a big fan of it. And the casting wasn't that great, the elves and queen were well casted and were perfect! But the actress for Snow White was bad, she didn't really look like the original... for me at least. I'm not saying she shouldn't act again, I'm just saying that she wasn't the right one for Snow White. Another thing I should clarify is that I know that the film isn't for me, it's for the younger audience. But a film for kids should also be for the adults/family.

"Sometimes the fairest of them all is the one that challenges your comfort zone.

I have never gone to see a film purely because of how much backlash it was receiving, but-well-there is a first time for everything. The controversy around Disney's live-action Snow White intrigued me. The outrage, the think pieces, the online vitriol-it all made me wonder what, exactly, people were so furious about.

So I went in with no expectations. No nostalgia bias. No need to defend the original. And I was absolutely blown away.

Let me say this plainly: there is nothing wrong with this film. Nothing. If its message-of strength, compassion, justice, and self-determination-bothers you, then the problem is not with Snow White. The problem is you.

Imagine being upset about a story where a young woman rises to face evil, saves her kingdom, refuses to be passive, finds love without surrendering her independence, and dares to do what is right even when it is dangerous. That is the story this film tells, and it tells it with heart, humor, and visual beauty.

The performances are vibrant, the sets and costumes are lush and imaginative, and the direction is sure-handed. There is joy in this film. A sense of play. A deliberate balance between honoring the classic tale and reinterpreting it for a generation that sees the world through a more inclusive and complex lens.

Were there things that could have been done differently? Certainly. No film is perfect. But the core of this one-its spirit, its message, its visual and emotional execution-is solid. More than solid. It is delightful.

Would I take children to see this? Absolutely. Not only would I take them, I would encourage them to watch the original animated Snow White first and then experience this new version. Let them see how stories evolve over time. Let them see that heroines can grow stronger, villains more nuanced, and messages more resonant.

And if it bothers you that Snow White is not the same as she was in 1937... well, I do not know what to tell you.

"After years of controversy, drama, multiple delays and reshoots, the live action remake of the 1937 Disney animated classic, Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs, is finally here. Seeing all the never-ending controversies and multiple reshoots, I didn't had high hopes for it and well.........let's just get into the review.

Starting with the positives. I like that they fleshed out Snow White's character more by giving her a proper backstory and an 'I Want' song and Rachel Zegler's luminous performance was easily the part about the movie. Her gorgeous singing and chemistry with the other actors was a delight to watch. Andrew Burnap as Jonathan was a pleasant surprise. He was hilarious and charming and his chemistry with Rachel is great. Out of the dwarfs, Dopey was the highlight and I like that they gave his character more depth and surprise twist. The other dwarfs were fun to watch (not their designs) as well, particularly Doc and Grumpy. The costume design and production design were beautiful, the visuals were whimsical and enchanting particularly the forest and the dwarfs' cottage and the CGI animals looked adorable.

But the movie has some glaring issues that I could not look past such as Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen. Her performance feels so flat, boring and uninteresting and is far inferior to her animated counterpart. Nor is she any good at singing either which is a shame because her solo number ""All Is Fair"" is actually kinda catchy but she just ruins it with her awful singing. It felt like she was just there to serve looks and nothing else. Then there's the CGI dwarfs. Oh my!! They looked so uncanny valley something straight out of the Polar Express animation which was so distracting. The new songs, though decent, do not mesh well with the old-timey tunes of the original and instead feel like generic broadway pop numbers. And the plot feels messy as it is muddled with so many story beats that it kinda falls apart. It seems to have an identity crisis as it tries to follow the original story while incorporating its own plot points instead of faithfully adapting the source material. The love story was very uninspired and lacked depth. There are so many new characters added who serve nothing to the plot (heck some doesn't even have any dialogues) and were completely unnecessary.

"Ok, so i watched the Snow White remake out of curiosity with my little niece (not a fan in general of these remakes that Disney keeps churning out) and... it's just ok, nothing else.

Let's start with the positives: Rachel Zegler gives her all with the material she's been given (especially her enjoyable rendition of ""Whistle While You Work"" that was delightful), the set design is gorgeous and some of the songs aren't that bad.

But unfortunately, i have to talk about the negatives: the plot is a jumbled mess, the changes made to the original story are unnecessary, the abysmal CGI (ESPECIALLY the Seven Dwarves that reach uncanny valley territory!) and a complete miscast of the villain played by Gal Gadot: she doesn't strike me at all as the bad guy, her performance & singing voice are so over-the-top and goofy that it's hard being invested in her, especially compared to the original which was one of the best villains in movie history (then again, the screenplay did not help her at all)

Just a bland remake with a few saving graces, period.",5/10,ok watched snow white remake curiosity little niece fan general remakes disney keeps churning ok nothing else let start positives rachel zegler gives material given especially enjoyable rendition whistle work delightful set design gorgeous songs bad unfortunately talk negatives plot jumbled mess changes made original story unnecessary abysmal cgi especially seven dwarves reach uncanny valley territory complete miscast villain played gal gadot strike bad guy performance singing voice goofy hard invested especially compared original one best villains movie history screenplay help bland remake saving graces period,0.931,0.308,0.182,0.51

I guess they tried to keep the Snow White costumes for more exact nostalgia but ends up looking dated and cringeworthy.

"Amid several controversies and a troubled production, the latest Snow White live-action adaptation is finally out, and the verdict is this film is quite...average. Controversies about her casting aside, Rachel Zegler delivers a fine performance and basically carries the movie on her shoulders (and unlike another thespian I'll mention shortly, this girl can actually act). The story was changed in a few key parts, but still falls short of the magic of the 1937 original. Among the most jarring decisions, creating the dwarves using CGI so they resemble their animated counterparts was the worst of all, rendering an uncanny valley appearance which could be easily resolved by hiring seven actual little people for the job. And the other awful aspect was the casting of Gal Gadot. I always considered her to be an average actress at best, but this must be a career worst. Barring some real stinker performance coming along in the next months, they must already be engraving her Razzie as I type these words. Certainly there were more competent actresses that could infuse some life in this role, but Gadot's wooden cartoonish performance is atrocious, and even if Disney hired her on account of her fame alone, that plan certainly backfired as her acting is being heavily criticized and the box office projections don't seem promising. In the end, the movie is passable basically on Zegler's authentic performance and a bit of nostalgia for the original animated film. It's far from the disaster some were foreseeing, but is definitely a one-time watch which will come and go without leaving much of a mark.",5/10,amid several controversies troubled production latest snow white adaptation finally verdict film quite average controversies casting aside rachel zegler delivers fine performance basically carries movie shoulders unlike another thespian mention shortly girl actually act story changed key parts still falls short magic original among jarring decisions creating dwarves using cgi resemble animated counterparts worst rendering uncanny valley appearance could easily resolved hiring seven actual little people job awful aspect casting gal gadot always considered average actress best must career worst barring real stinker performance coming along next months must already engraving razzie type words certainly competent actresses could infuse life role gadot wooden cartoonish performance atrocious even disney hired account fame alone plan certainly backfired acting heavily criticized box office projections seem promising end movie passable basically zegler authentic performance bit nostalgia original animated film far disaster foreseeing definitely watch come go without leaving much mark,0.5945,0.185,0.137,0.678

"Disney's Snow White trailer promised, in capital letters: ""The classic story comes to life"". Nothing could be farther from the truth, as the more Disney makes these live action movies, the more they look like animated movies made by CGI. To the point that human actors feel almost out of place. It's as if the animation gene of the studio was too strong and it wanted to take over.

The other trend in Disney live action movies that is also visible in this Snow White is that they seem dominated by the guys making the cheap Disney Channel musicals, or the people making the Broadway shows. Highly choreographed musical numbers designed and filmed as if we were just sitting in a theatre, as opposed to with a film lens.

Beyond that, as live action Disney remakes go, Snow White is better than average without ever being great. To those criticizing the movie for steering too far from the original, it's probably worth reminding them that the original is a tale from 1812, and the 1937 Disney movie took plenty of liberties relative to that original already. So yes, it's okay for Snow White to be of latin descent, for Prince Charming not to be a prince, and so on. We expect filmmakers to adapt stories over time, and for whatever reason they want.

The issue with Disney remakes is actually that they don't evolve enough relative to the animated version. In that regard, Snow White tries harder than others. And the new scenes are where the movie seems to find its wings and is able to breathe. But it's weighed down by the requirements to reproduce entire scenes from the animated film. Long scenes where it's clear the filmmakers are checking boxes and don't have their hearts in it.",5/10,disney snow white trailer promised capital letters classic story comes life nothing could farther truth disney makes live action movies look like animated movies made cgi point human actors feel almost place animation gene studio strong wanted take trend disney live action movies also visible snow white seem dominated guys making cheap disney channel musicals people making broadway shows highly choreographed musical numbers designed filmed sitting theatre opposed film lens beyond live action disney remakes go snow white better average without ever great criticizing movie steering far original probably worth reminding original tale disney movie took plenty liberties relative original already yes okay snow white latin descent prince charming prince expect filmmakers adapt stories time whatever reason want issue disney remakes actually evolve enough relative animated version regard snow white tries harder others new scenes movie seems find wings able breathe weighed requirements reproduce entire scenes animated film long scenes clear filmmakers checking boxes hearts,0.9808,0.208,0.029,0.763
"Disney has decided to kill imagination by turning their beloved classics into soulless live-action remakes. Rachel Zegler they can never make me hate you. She has talent and charm, she can sing and she can belt. She's made for the stage but we're lucky we can watch her on the screen. Gal Gadot was a serious miscast, there is nothing of hers that feels in place here. She's hidden under this costume and she can't sing and still they gave her a lot to do. The whole movie suffers from a really badly written script. There are many ideas that they could have built more on, but sadly they chose to explore many, without really giving any of them the space to develope into something fresh or bold or beautiful. I didn't expect this to be a musical, most of the modern songs were really cringe worthy and felt like they don't belong in this world of ""Snow White"". The seven dwarfs honestly are an outrage, I really won't ever understand how this felt acceptable. Sadly there are many things that kill the joy in the movie, and the serious problem is the pacing and the plot that's all over the place. There are casting problems, and song problems, and fantasy problems and so ""Snow White"" will be shelved at the shelf of the really bad Disney remakes which lately has become really overcrowded.",4/10,disney decided kill imagination turning beloved classics soulless remakes rachel zegler never make hate talent charm sing belt made stage lucky watch screen gal gadot serious miscast nothing feels place hidden costume ca sing still gave lot whole movie suffers really badly written script many ideas could built sadly chose explore many without really giving space develope something fresh bold beautiful expect musical modern songs really cringe worthy felt like belong world snow white seven dwarfs honestly outrage really wo ever understand felt acceptable sadly many things kill joy movie serious problem pacing plot place casting problems song problems fantasy problems snow white shelved shelf really bad disney remakes lately become really overcrowded,-0.8805,0.212,0.279,0.509

"I went to the theater with an open mind, trying my best to set aside the original story and avoid making comparisons. I just wanted to watch a movie, immerse myself in the story, and be entertained for two hours.

The result of my experience, still avoiding deeper analysis or comparisons, is that it's an okay movie. Nothing exceptional. The storyline is okay, the acting is okay (for a Disney princess movie), though there are some weak spots in the plot, as well as in the way certain moments of tension are developed and resolved. But I wouldn't call it terrible, far from it.

If I were to start making comparisons and analyzing the producers' choices (some of which I find downright ridiculous), my opinion would drop significantly. But I don't think it's fair to dislike, or hate, the movie for what I consider the wrong reasons.

This movie should be judged for what it is, on its own terms. And my honest take? It's an okay movie. Nothing remarkable, but far from awful.

"Snow White is definitely nothing groundbreaking or new. It is a rather dull and formulaic remake, which doesn't reach the heights of other Disney remakes of recent years. It is still a perfectly fun family film, which is generally well made. It is mainly let down by the poor performance by Gal Gadot as the evil Queen, as well as a jumbled and formulaic storyline whi h definitely drags towards the end.

The old songs are very charming, and the new ones are fairly memorable (if a little bit dull and formulaic). The stand outs in the film are Rachel Zegler as Snow White, and Jonathan, who provide fun and perfectly good performances. The romance between the two is a bit forced, as there is not a huge amount of chemistry.

The dwarves are also somewhat of a stand out in the film, especially dopey. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the CGI design of the characters, but they added a lighthertedness to the film, and were well voiced. I especially like the Hi-Ho sequence, but in general, the dwarves were quite forgettable.

"In summary: Audiovisual carries the film and it's definitely a decent family watch.

In detail: Despite the rewrites from the original Snow White story by Disney, this film still somehow pulls off a little touch of magic in its world. In this case, the two major things that uplift its quality are the music and CGI. The music really delivers its authentic feel with modern ensemble, performed beautifully by the casts. The CGI on the other hand, dwarves especially, really bring them out to life without leaving important resemblances of the classic.

Unfortunately, performance wise, Rachel Zegler (debatably) actually has it, theatrically. Definitely not for the look, character, and soul of Snow White. On Gal 's end, she has performed absolutely terribly, expressionless and unnaturally forced as usual (usual being her performance in other films). As for the other casts, they perform normally well.

She delivers every line like she's reading it for the first time - from a cue card - held by someone who gave up halfway through. Charisma? Nowhere to be found. It's as if she was cast for the role of ""girl who doesn't want to be here,"" and boy, did she commit.

The chemistry between characters is non-existent, the plot feels like it was written during a coffee break, and the dwarfs? Don't even get me started. They're less ""whimsical companions"" and more ""NPCs who glitched through casting.""

"The 2025 Snow White film presents an intriguing storyline that successfully reimagines the classic fairy tale while incorporating a unique blend of animation and live-action, reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?. The visual style creates a fantastical world where animated elements seamlessly interact with human characters, giving the film a distinct and imaginative feel.

However, one notable aspect of the film is its heavy reliance on singing. While music plays a crucial role in many Disney adaptations, this version may feel overwhelming to viewers who prefer a more balanced approach to storytelling. The sheer amount of singing at times detracts from the narrative, making certain scenes feel drawn out rather than progressing the plot effectively.

Despite this, the film's resolution is satisfying and uplifting. The ending brings the kingdom's people together, emphasizing unity and the power of hope. The Evil Stepmother faces a fitting downfall, as she is ultimately banished, ensuring that peace is restored to the land. This resolution leaves the door open for further storytelling, making it a strong candidate for expansion into a television series, much like Once Upon a Time.

"I don't even know where to start with this disaster. As someone who grew up loving the original Snow White, I was cautiously optimistic about this remake. But wow... Disney somehow managed to suck all the magic, charm, and fun out of a classic and replace it with a preachy, lifeless mess.

What went wrong?

Where are the dwarfs? One of the most iconic parts of the story is gone, replaced by random companions that have zero personality or chemistry. Why even call it Snow White if you're just going to rewrite everything?

Snow White herself... yikes. The lead actress might be talented, but her take on the character is cold and unlikable. Snow White is supposed to be kind and full of wonder, but here she's just... kind of smug? Instead of inspiring, she just lectures everyone.

The Prince? Nope. Apparently, romance is outdated now, so they just removed the Prince altogether. The original story wasn't about a girl waiting to be saved-it was about kindness and believing in love. Now, it's just a dull hero's journey with no heart.

The visuals are shockingly bad. Disney has the budget for breathtaking CGI, but somehow, this film looks cheap and lifeless. The forest is bland, the creatures look weird, and even the costumes feel off.

The songs? Forgettable. You won't be humming any of these tracks after leaving the theater. They pale in comparison to the classics, and none of them have that Disney magic.

"A Complete Disaster

This movie is an absolute trainwreck from start to finish. The plot is incoherent, riddled with clichés, and drags on with no sense of pacing. The dialogue is lifeless, filled with awkward exposition and cringe-worthy one-liners. The acting is stiff and unconvincing, making it impossible to connect with any of the characters.

"Snow White is a grotesque, soulless cash-grab so devoid of charm it makes the Evil Queen's poisoned apple look appetizing by comparison. This live-action travesty takes the 1937 masterpiece-a film that once defined wonder-and stomps it into a CGI-smeared puddle of corporate cynicism.

Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, meanwhile, slinks around like a discount store mannequin, her thin voice and thinner presence turning a legendary villain into a parody of itself.

"Ah, Snow White-a film about kindness, courage, and standing up to injustice. Too bad none of that translated off-screen.

Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot take center stage in this lifeless, CGI-drenched remake, delivering performances as hollow as their silence on real-world oppression. Zegler's Snow White talks a big game about being a leader, but leadership apparently stops where uncomfortable truths begin. Meanwhile, Gadot's Evil Queen is more believable than ever-maybe because playing a villain is easier when you're already ignoring human suffering.

The visuals? Bland. The storytelling? Sanitized beyond recognition. The heart? Nowhere to be found. Disney had the chance to bring something fresh to the table, but instead, they served up a lukewarm mess with a side of corporate cowardice.

"I suspect that MANY of these reviews are written out of pure spite by people who haven't seen the movie. The first review I read criticized Snow White's hair, when the reason why it looks so bad was made obvious early in the movie. For all of the clueless haters out there, it was intentional. You don't deserve more than that.

I saw it yesterday and absolutely loved it!

In contrast, the original movie is now very archaic, both in style and in the storytelling. Personally, the original Snow White's voice really grates on my nerves. She reminds me of some sort of Betty Boop character. In the original version, Snow White is basically a victim, who is rescued by her ""true love,"" with whom she has not even had a simple conversation. To be blunt, she is not much of a role model.

This interpretation, building upon the original structure, is much more complex, full of depth, and Snow White is a much stronger lead now, as is her love interest, Jonathan. They are both taking an active role in pushing back against the evil queen to restore their once-happy kingdom. Rachel (such a beautiful voice) and Andrew were relatable and made for a great couple. Gal Gadot did a great job as the very, very evil stepmother/queen. And I loved the expanded role of the dwarfs, especially Dopey, of course!

I thought the visuals were beautiful, and enjoyed most of the music. I was already a big fan of composers Pasek and Paul (The Greatest Showman, Smash, La La Land, 2019 live action Aladdin).

I believe that this updated version will be much more appealing to kids (especially little girls).

"5 year olds are not the target audience -

This is a live action remake, with a plot and animation style which are not intended for young children.

It's child-friendly, and children can enjoy the colors/the singing, but by no means were children thought of as the primary target audience of this film..

The casting (while certainly diverse), is not hurt by the casting of Rachel Zegler, nor Gal Godot.

Disney would be far better off making a much darker film (for adults), than they were here (straddling the line between a film for adults and a film for all ages).

These live-actions are not popular with young children, yet they are not dark enough for the adult audience which grew up with these films and who actually wants to see the films.

Children have a 5-20 minute attention span and generally appear to care more about the colors and cartoon/animation... Yet, Snow-White a long with The Lion King (amongst others) lack a meaningful story to keep the adults entertained.

"I found the movie quite cringe-worthy at several points. The acting felt unnatural, especially between the hero and villain, and I just couldn't connect with the main character. The development was really lacking. If they wanted to stray so far from the original story, they should have just created a new character and given them a proper arc.

I get that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic, but honestly, it does not hold up.

She spends most of the movie singing, cleaning, or being helpless until she falls into a coma-great role model.

"I went to the theater with an open mind, trying my best to set aside the original story and avoid making comparisons (I am 46 years old). I just wanted to watch a movie, immerse myself in the story, and be entertained for two hours.

The result of my experience, still avoiding deeper analysis or comparisons, is that it's an okay movie. Nothing exceptional. The storyline is okay, the acting is okay (for a Disney princess movie), though there are some weak spots in the plot, as well as in the way certain moments of tension are developed and resolved.

But I wouldn't call it terrible, far from it.

If I were to start making comparisons and analyzing the producers' choices (some of which I find downright ridiculous), my opinion would drop significantly. But I really don't think it's fair to dislike (or hate) the movie for what I consider the wrong reasons.

"When Disney announced a live-action adaptation of Snow White, many fans hoped for a faithful retelling of the beloved fairy tale. Unfortunately, this version strays so far from the original that it feels like a completely different story-one that lacks the heart, charm, and timeless magic that made the animated classic so special.

The Main Character: A Major Letdown

The biggest flaw in this adaptation is Snow White herself. In the original, she is kind, gentle, and full of hope-traits that define her strength. However, in this version, she is completely unrecognizable. Instead of embodying the grace and optimism that made her a beloved character, she comes across as overly rebellious, dismissive, and even unlikable at times. Her attitude feels forced, as if the movie is trying too hard to make her a modern heroine while completely missing what made her special in the first place.

The original Snow White is a story about innocence, kindness, and the triumph of good over evil. This adaptation, however, strips away the fairy tale charm, replacing it with unnecessary changes that add little to the story. The dwarfs, the prince, and even the Evil Queen lack the depth and presence they had in the original. Instead of enhancing the story, the film seems determined to ""fix"" things that were never broken, resulting in a version that feels hollow and disconnected from its source material.

A Disservice to Childhood Memories

For those who grew up loving Snow White, this adaptation is nothing short of disappointing. It takes a classic tale and twists it into something that barely resembles the story we all cherished. Instead of celebrating the original's timeless themes, it undermines them, leaving behind a movie that fails to capture the magic, warmth, and wonder of the classic fairy tale.

Final Verdict: 2/10

This live-action Snow White is a perfect example of why some stories are best left untouched. Instead of reimagining the tale with love and respect, it distances itself from everything that made the original so enchanting. If you're looking for nostalgia and fairy tale magic, it's better to revisit the 1937 classic rather than waste time on this disappointing remake.",1/10,disney announced adaptation snow white many fans hoped faithful retelling beloved fairy tale unfortunately version strays far original feels like completely different lacks heart charm timeless magic made animated classic special main character major letdown biggest flaw adaptation snow white original kind gentle full define strength however version completely unrecognizable instead embodying grace optimism made beloved character comes across overly rebellious dismissive even unlikable times attitude feels forced movie trying hard make modern heroine completely missing made special first place story loses magic original snow white story innocence kindness triumph good evil adaptation however strips away fairy tale charm replacing unnecessary changes add little story dwarfs prince even evil queen lack depth presence original instead enhancing story film seems determined fix things never broken resulting version feels hollow disconnected source material disservice childhood memories grew loving snow white adaptation nothing short disappointing takes classic tale twists something barely resembles story cherished instead celebrating original timeless themes undermines leaving behind movie fails capture magic warmth wonder classic fairy tale final verdict snow white perfect example stories best left untouched instead reimagining tale love respect distances everything made original enchanting looking nostalgia fairy tale magic better revisit classic rather waste time disappointing remake,0.9974,0.384,0.111,0.505
A bit hard to know where to start with this one. I suppose the opening will do. Firstly an explanation of the intent of the movie is given in the opening piece followed by a forgettable song and plastic acting. Anything good will let the movie tell it's story. The watcher will learn this as the movie decelops. The opening is followed by a story that is not Snow White. Call it a different name but this is not Snow White. The magic has been lost and what follows are just more forgettable songs and poor acting. The effects look good but this is 2025 and with the budget this should be expected. The storyline was confusing and not the quality of Disney from even 10 years ago.

"I absolutely loved the movie! They finally brought back the magic of colors, making every scene visually stunning and vibrant. The songs are incredibly captivating, adding an extra layer of charm and emotion to the story. Of course, like any movie, it has a few flaws, but that's completely normal and doesn't take away from the overall experience. The film does a fantastic job of retelling the story in a fresh, engaging, and entertaining way. It's the perfect introduction for a new generation. Remember, the target audience is children, so enjoy it with that in mind!

"I fully appreciate that fantasy allows for creativity-it can be reimagined, adapted, and even completely transformed.

That being said, I never expected Walt Disney Studios to take such a bold approach in reinterpreting a beloved, cross-generational classic like Snow White.

I fully support the creation of new stories with diverse characters and fresh narratives that reflect modern perspectives. However, some classics hold deep sentimental value across multiple generations. As someone who grew up with Snow White, this film is ingrained in my core memories, just as it is for those before and after me. Classics like these should be preserved and cherished, as they reflect the artistic and cultural values of their time.

While inclusivity and fresh perspectives in storytelling are important, significant alterations to such an iconic film risk diluting its original essence. A balance should be found-one that allows for new narratives to flourish without rewriting the legacy of timeless classics.

"For the record, I do like Marc Webb as a director. Great filmmaker with generally a great creative mind and eye for detail with whatever material he deals with.

With Snow White, I was generally able to look past the casting. Rachel Zegler is a fine actress and the way Disney is, it should have been no surprise they would go in that direction and it's not her fault they paid her millions to play the role.

However, the big red flag was the cast, crew and Disney themselves almost denouncing the original film as outdated and offensive, cause lord knows that's how you promote your remake of a film that your studio made. They also seem to forget that it wasn't even Disney's story, it was based on a classic fairytale.

Plot-wise, this is fairly close to the original. It's brand new, so I'll refrain from giving away too much. However, if you've seen Disney's recent remakes or reimagining's, you could probably guess what things they might have kept and what they changed to ""modernize"" this in their way.

With that said, the changes did cause me to roll my eyes a bit. Particularly with the changes to the Prince...sorry Jonathan and Snow White herself. Gal Gadot does really well as the Queen and kind of made me wish for a while movie about her instead of the remake. She is actually the one that kept this film partially afloat for me.

The Seven Dwarfs, for the most part were a big relief. They kept them far closer to the original than I and so many thought. So, that was a relief.

So overall, I'll give this a 3/10. I forgave it a little more than most because my kid did love it, so that counts. However, it's easy to see why many weren't forgiving because these changes from Disney are getting a little tiring and I think this film proved how burnt many are feeling from these lackluster remakes.",3/10,record like marc webb director great filmmaker generally great creative mind eye detail whatever material deals snow white generally able look past casting rachel zegler fine actress way disney surprise would go direction fault paid millions play role however big red flag cast crew disney almost denouncing original film outdated offensive cause lord knows promote remake film studio made also seem forget even disney story based classic fairytale fairly close original brand new refrain giving away much however seen disney recent remakes reimagining could probably guess things might kept changed modernize way said changes cause roll eyes bit particularly changes prince sorry jonathan snow white gal gadot really well queen kind made wish movie instead remake actually one kept film partially afloat seven dwarfs part big relief kept far closer original many thought relief overall give forgave little kid love counts however easy see many forgiving changes disney getting little tiring think film proved burnt many feeling lackluster remakes,0.9929,0.295,0.045,0.659
"Disney's 2015 remake of Cinderella is truly magical. I have watched it at least once a year or maybe more since it came out. It's a masterful piece of storytelling, acting and cinematography that stirs your emotions and makes you feel something real. The whole movie you're rooting for Cinderella to overcome her oppression and live happily ever after. They remained true to the original story that people have loved for generations. To me it is a work of art.

10 years on, Disney has failed to mirror the same success with their remake of Snow White and I will not be watching this once a year moving forward, most likely I'll never watch it again. I found it difficult to like any of the characters. For me it was neither magical nor enchanting and has not captured my heart.

"I couldn't connect with the world or the characters.

At this point it's safe to say that this film is suffering from...money laundering.

I believe they are just purchasing these ideas just to move cash around unnoticed but forget to think that if your stories are badly written and produced it's going to start becoming a bit suspicious over the years.

Why does Disney want to change stories from the past and instead embrace some of its more interesting themes and memorable moments.

"I just watched the 2025 Snow White remake, and I'm still reeling from the experience. Unfortunately, it was a mixed bag, with Gal Gadot's cringeworthy performance as the Evil Queen being a major letdown. Her acting was stilted, and her singing was downright painful.¹ It's a shame, really, given her talent in other films.

On the other hand, Rachel Zegler was an absolute delight as Snow White. She brought a newfound depth to the character, and her singing voice was stunning. She's a true star, and her performance was the only thing that kept me invested in the movie.

The film's visuals were also a bit of a disappointment. The CGI was overused, and the dwarves looked more like creepy dolls than lovable characters. The pacing was also off, with some scenes feeling rushed and others feeling like they dragged on forever.

Overall, I'd give Snow White 3.0 out of 10 stars. While Zegler's performance was a highlight, the rest of the movie was a bit of a mess. If you're a die-hard Disney fan, you might enjoy it, but otherwise, it's a skippable remake.

"It's not a ten but apparently this movie is vein rated all sorts of crazy things, so I'll join that trend.

Rachel Zegler is amazing, wonderful singer, and adds this beautiful classical Disney princess animation to her acting - if you see the film, you know what I mean.

The movie has some great new original songs, that are propper bobs.

The movie has all the original story points, and just expands on this - which I think is what the remakes should do! Be nostalgic but also bring something new to the party.

Gal Gadot was miscast - this part could have been so fun with the right actress. I think issue is Gal Gadot can't get the evilness across without beeing cartoonish sit in leather chair and pet a cat kind of way. But when she has to be big and campy, it like she's worried about looking silly and then by default falls a bit flat.

"Snow White, Disney's latest film, is a fresh take on the 1937 animated classic. Director Marc Webb gives the film a Broadway twist, making it more than just a nostalgic tale. With the addition of new songs and character development, the film adds a deeper dimension to the Snow White story.

Rachel Zegler does a great job of playing Snow White, giving the character more depth and spunk. She maintains the graceful movements of the animated Snow White, but with a new twist of spunk. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen gives a charming performance, although her voice doesn't always match the character.

The film has some flaws, such as the CGI effects that don't always work and the costumes look cheap. However, Webb manages to keep the film interesting with dynamic scenes and bright colors.

"Enjoyed it very much, especially the first half. Perfect? No.. no movie is perfect, but such fanservice! The singing is amazing as well! Catchy new songs as well by the way. The story itself has a few changes here and there if you compare to the original, but some of these changes were more logic / realistic if you ask me. The Evil Queen could have been a bit 'more', I find her a bit too passive aggressive. All by all, the movie gave me that wonderous feeling I had as a child watching SnowWhite. The effects were good enough for me. Only the dwarfs seemed indeed a bit rushed. Liked the balance though between real animals and the Disney kind of animals. Really enjoyed it, didn't expect it actually. 🙂",8/10,enjoyed much especially first half perfect movie perfect fanservice singing amazing well catchy new songs well way story changes compare original changes logic realistic ask evil queen could bit find bit passive aggressive movie gave wonderous feeling child watching snowwhite effects good enough dwarfs seemed indeed bit rushed liked balance though real animals disney kind animals really enjoyed expect actually,0.9822,0.422,0.068,0.51
"My roommates and I went and saw this movie expecting the worst and were prepared to walk out if it was terrible. We were pleasantly surprised by how well Disney adapted the original Snow White while also adding the smallest twist to appeal more to younger audiences. The plot of the movie follows the original pretty closely with a couple of extra scenes added to develop Snow White and other characters. There were no major deviances from the original movie, except of the Evil Queen's death.

The musical numbers were gas, fire, flames. Genuinely the best part of the movie was anytime someone sang, which was the majority of the movie. Snow White's dress was stunning, and the Evil Queen's design was also well done. The only horrible outfit was the main guy's, but it wasn't super distracting. He was charming and convincing as Snow's love interest. Gal Gadot also did great as the Evil Queen, her performance was dramatic like a classic Disney villain and scared me just as much as the original. The color grading and cinematography were also pretty good. It did not look dull or lifeless like the Little Mermaid did.

The only major cons of this movie are the seven dwarves and the pacing. Every time the dwarves were on screen it was jarring, but despite that I still found myself emotionally connecting with these characters. There was also an issue with how jarring some of the transitions were between scenes and the shift in tone. Some parts of the plot were not fully explained/developed. I think a majority of the critics of this movie are forgetting that it is meant for kids, and are upset that it is not a carbon copy of the original.

While the movie is not perfect, I would recommend seeing this movie if you like musicals or have kids. Just don't expect it to be as good as the original if Snow White is one of your favorites.",8/10,roommates went saw movie expecting worst prepared walk terrible pleasantly surprised well disney adapted original snow white also adding smallest twist appeal younger audiences plot movie follows original pretty closely couple extra scenes added develop snow white characters major deviances original movie except evil queen death musical numbers gas fire flames genuinely best part movie anytime someone sang majority movie snow white dress stunning evil queen design also well done horrible outfit main guy super distracting charming convincing snow love interest gal gadot also great evil queen performance dramatic like classic disney villain scared much original color grading cinematography also pretty good look dull lifeless like little mermaid major cons movie seven dwarves pacing every time dwarves screen jarring despite still found emotionally connecting characters also issue jarring transitions scenes shift tone parts plot fully think majority critics movie forgetting meant kids upset carbon copy original movie perfect would recommend seeing movie like musicals kids expect good original snow white one favorites,0.9825,0.331,0.188,0.48
"Went into this expecting to hate it, but surprisingly I didn't, because it was an enjoyable film. Stays true to the original but adds new elements to it. Gal Gadot and Rachel Ziegler may have had bad tension off camera, but it didn't come through on camera.

Now I'm not saying this movie is great, the problems are with musical numbers, they just don't become something you want to sing too.

The animals had a friendly cartoony look that really worked, Rachel Zegler and Andrew Burnap had amazing chemistry and it was adorable.

Honestly worth the watch. Despite changes for a modern audience Snow White still tells an authentic story that stays true to the animated original. Adding more to the story in a just way. Such as the back story for the live interest that isn't really in the original animated and while fantastical and disneyfied brings out that disney magic that is true to these fairytale stories. Gripping you from the start with some outstanding songs that stick with you. Would pay to see again and again. Doesn't quite take the top spot for me but it's almost the best so far.

I went in expecting a bad movie but was pleasantly surprised how it turned out! I took 2 points off because the special effects and CGI was really bad on the dwarves.

"The movie was nothing short of breathtaking-a visually stunning and emotionally rich tribute to the classic. Every element, from the cinematography to the performances, captured the magic and wonder that made the original so beloved. The music, in particular, was a highlight, with each song feeling as though it belonged on a grand Broadway stage, elevating the film's charm and emotional depth.

Yet, despite its brilliance, some continue to insist, ""Don't touch the classics,"" as if adaptations somehow diminish the legacy of the original. Ironically, many seem to forget that Snow White itself was never a Disney invention but rather an adaptation of the timeless tale by the Brothers Grimm. Stories evolve, just as they always have, finding new ways to resonate with different generations. Dismissing reinterpretations simply because they dare to reimagine a beloved story is shortsighted and ignores the very nature of storytelling.

At its core, this film is not a replacement but a heartfelt homage-a love letter to the classic that respects its origins while breathing fresh life into it. It reminds us that the beauty of stories lies not just in preserving them but in allowing them to grow, ensuring they continue to inspire for years to come.",10/10,movie nothing short visually stunning emotionally rich tribute classic every element cinematography performances captured magic wonder made original beloved music particular highlight song feeling though belonged grand broadway stage elevating film charm emotional depth yet despite brilliance continue insist touch classics adaptations somehow diminish legacy original ironically many seem forget snow white never disney invention rather adaptation timeless tale brothers grimm stories evolve always finding new ways resonate different generations dismissing reinterpretations simply dare reimagine beloved story shortsighted ignores nature storytelling core film replacement heartfelt love letter classic respects origins breathing fresh life reminds us beauty stories lies preserving allowing grow ensuring continue inspire years come,0.987,0.333,0.084,0.583

The shallow description of her from the original is completely absent here and even her name got more interesting. I also enjoyed Dopey's character arc and Jonathan.

"I never thought I'd say this-but Snow White has become one of my favorite princesses.

Growing up, the 1937 classic never really spoke to me. Snow White felt passive, distant-more a symbol than a character. Aside from the Once Upon a Time TV show version, she had always been my least favorite princess.

But Disney's 2025 Snow White changed everything.

This reimagining gave us the heroine we always needed: fearless, fair, brave, and true. She's no longer just waiting to be rescued-she leads with heart, makes bold choices, and shines with purpose. I saw myself in her strength, her flaws, her hope. It was powerful.

The film is pure magic. The music? Absolutely sing-along worthy-I've had the soundtrack on loop since I left the theater. It captures the spirit of a fairy tale while feeling completely fresh. The tone reminded me of Enchanted, The Princess Bride, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Tangled, and Ella Enchanted-clever, heartfelt, and fun, with just the right dose of whimsy.

Without giving anything away, I'll just say the story moved me in ways I didn't expect. I laughed, teared up, and left the theater feeling lighter, like I'd just witnessed something special.

This isn't just a remake. It's a reinvention. And now, Snow White isn't just fair-she's fearless, brave, and true too.

"The movie is worth watching, and maybe is a little childish but it needs an opportunity. The songs are beautiful and it has to be made clear that it is a musical and for people who don't like musicals it will be more than obvious that this fact is just one more reason for them not to like the film.

The movie is very well represented and it's almost the same as the animated one.

It is very short, which is ideal for children so they won't be bored.

"Disney's 2025 live-action reimagining of ""Snow White"" has arrived, and while it attempts to modernize the classic fairy tale, it ultimately stumbles, leaving audiences with a mixed bag of disappointment and fleeting moments of charm. Directed by Marc Webb, the film stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, promising a fresh perspective on the beloved story. However, several missteps prevent it from achieving true ""amazing"" status.

One of the most significant issues lies in the film's script. The dialogue often feels clunky and unnatural, lacking the whimsical charm of the original. Key plot points are altered, but these changes don't necessarily enhance the story, sometimes even detracting from its emotional core. The seven dwarfs, a crucial element of the original, are reimagined with CGI that falls into the uncanny valley, proving more distracting than endearing.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is a highlight. She brings a refreshing sincerity and strength to the character, portraying her as more proactive and less passive than in the animated version. Her vocal talents are undeniable, and she delivers the new songs with passion but Disney could have hired another actor who's white as snow because in the animated movie the magic mirror describes snow white's skin as ""white as snow"".

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is another bright spot. She infuses the character with a captivating blend of vanity and menace, making her a compelling antagonist. Her performance hints at the potential the film had, but it's ultimately overshadowed by the weaker aspects of the production.

Visually, ""Snow White"" is a mixed bag. While some scenes capture the fairytale atmosphere, others suffer from cheap-looking CGI and uninspired set design.

The film's attempts to modernize the story also fall flat. While updating certain aspects for contemporary audiences is understandable, ""Snow White"" seems unsure of its target audience, resulting in a film that doesn't fully satisfy either nostalgic fans of the original or those seeking a fresh, modern take.

But overall the film is really good! I didn't like where the seven dwarfs were CGI and they could've replaced them with real actors with dwarfism. But other than that it's honestly quite spectacular.",10/10,disney reimagining snow white arrived attempts modernize classic fairy tale ultimately stumbles leaving audiences mixed bag disappointment fleeting moments charm directed marc webb film stars rachel zegler snow white gal gadot evil queen promising fresh perspective beloved story however several missteps prevent achieving true amazing status one significant issues lies film script dialogue often feels clunky unnatural lacking whimsical charm original key plot points altered changes necessarily enhance story sometimes even detracting emotional core seven dwarfs crucial element original reimagined cgi falls uncanny valley proving distracting endearing rachel zegler performance snow white highlight brings refreshing sincerity strength character portraying proactive less passive animated version vocal talents undeniable delivers new songs passion disney could hired another actor white snow animated movie magic mirror describes snow white skin white snow gal gadot portrayal evil queen another bright spot infuses character captivating blend vanity menace making compelling antagonist performance hints potential film ultimately overshadowed weaker aspects production visually snow white mixed bag scenes capture fairytale atmosphere others suffer cgi uninspired set design film attempts modernize story also fall flat updating certain aspects contemporary audiences understandable snow white seems unsure target audience resulting film fully satisfy either nostalgic fans original seeking fresh modern take overall film really good like seven dwarfs cgi could replaced real actors dwarfism honestly quite spectacular,0.9815,0.251,0.119,0.63

It shows what beauty is- to share and to be thankful for what you are and what you have whatever that is. And on the other hand the contrast is enviousness, selfishness, egoism and the worst desire of all- to be more than the others, to be above them and to want the others to worship you.

"Snow White has that pure Disney magic, thanks to some incredible new music and a fantastic lead performance from Rachel Zegler! Waiting on a Wish was worth the price of admission alone! I had a smile on my face the whole time, it made the Disney adult in me very happy and worked very well as an adaptation of the original 1937 animated film. As someone who never really loved the original besides the appreciation of the history and the art behind it, I was way more into this version of the story! Not only that but unlike some other Disney live-action adaptations, this was a true adaptation of the story rather than pure nostalgic mimicry like The Lion King was! I liked the moments and songs that they kept, and I liked the changes they made! While not every choice in the movie works, director Marc Webb did a solid job bringing this fairytale to life with only a few missteps here and there. It can be clunky, and moments didn't always feel earned by the film especially when it came to emotion, but it still had that magical Disney feel to it. And it boasts some of the best new Disney music in years! Waiting on a Wish is spectacular, Good Things Grow is a perfect opening, Princess Problems is so fun, and A Hand Meets a Hand is gorgeous. The extensions/reworking of some of the classic songs like Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work were fantastic too and I was so happy to see those sequences come to life - it made me feel the same way I do when I go to Disneyland! The music was my favourite part for sure - songwriters Pasek and Paul did a fantastic job here! Another pro: Rachel Zegler was born to play a Disney princess! She is a naturally gifted performer, and she enchants as Snow White with her stunning singing voice and inherent charm. She is a star and one of the best parts and main reasons to see the film! Gal Gadot, on the other hand, is horribly miscast and one of the worst parts of the film, delivering a performance full of horrid line readings. I've come to expect little from these Disney remakes, but Snow White ended up being genuinely great! It's flawed, but it's one of the better remakes and I loved the changes they made while honouring what we love about the original - it is worth a watch for Disney fans! It's a magical delight - I was so surprised at how much I liked it! Much better than people are making it out to be!",8/10,snow white pure disney magic thanks incredible new music fantastic lead performance rachel zegler waiting wish worth price admission alone smile face whole time made disney adult happy worked well adaptation original animated film someone never really loved original besides appreciation history art behind way version story unlike disney adaptations true adaptation story rather pure nostalgic mimicry like lion king liked moments songs kept liked changes made every choice movie works director marc webb solid job bringing fairytale life missteps clunky moments always feel earned film especially came emotion still magical disney feel boasts best new disney music years waiting wish spectacular good things grow perfect opening princess problems fun hand meets hand gorgeous classic songs like whistle work fantastic happy see sequences come life made feel way go disneyland music favourite part sure songwriters pasek paul fantastic job another pro rachel zegler born play disney princess naturally gifted performer enchants snow white stunning singing voice inherent charm star one best parts main reasons see film gal gadot hand horribly miscast one worst parts film delivering performance full horrid line readings come expect little disney remakes snow white ended genuinely great flawed one better remakes loved changes made honouring love original worth watch disney fans magical delight surprised much liked much better people making,0.9984,0.407,0.071,0.522

"It was so amazing I loved it so much! Rachel's one of the best actresses of this generation and I loved seeing her as Snow White.

"Even though I had many prejudices, I loved the movie. One of the most beautiful live action. I don't understand so much hate, the show is fun and exciting. There are some differences with the original classic, that I love, but I still found it fresh and enjoyable. The scene in the cave is amazing.the musical show worthy of Broadway.

I saw the film with the group of differently abled kids I work with and they loved it, their attention span never dropped. A film that hits them in the heart.

"Magnificent, fairytale-like, mesmerizing, and healing for the inner child.

This reinterpretation delivers an even more impactful message. I believe both children and adults who watch it will gain valuable insights-learning to be gentle without being weak, strong without being hardened, and courageous while holding onto hope. Even just the stunning visuals make it worth watching, but beyond that, you also get to experience Rachel's incredible performance and enjoy beautiful music throughout. It's truly captivating, never dull for a moment. An outstanding viewing experience-I highly recommend it to anyone still on the fence.

"Snow White (2025) is a deeply emotional and breathtaking reimagining of the classic fairy tale that will leave you wiping away tears. This movie is not just a fairy tale; it's a rich, emotional journey about growth, loss, and self-discovery. Honestly, I wasn't prepared for how hard it would hit me, and by the end, I needed a box of tissues.

Positives:

Rachel Zegler shines as Snow White. She brings a modern, empowering take on the character, making her more than just a damsel in distress. Snow White is strong, relatable, and fully in control of her own destiny. Zegler captures both the innocence and the power of Snow White's journey, making her transformation feel real and heartfelt.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of Maleficent is truly stunning. While Maleficent is traditionally the villain, this version adds layers of depth to her character. Gadot's Maleficent is not just evil for the sake of it-she's a woman broken by betrayal and pain. There are moments when you can't help but sympathize with her, even though her actions are cruel. The final confrontation with Maleficent is emotional and earned, and while it's clear she deserves to be defeated, you still feel the weight of her loss. Gadot's performance brings a unique complexity to the character, making her defeat both satisfying and bittersweet.

One of the most charming parts of the film is the cuteness overdose with the animals. From Snow White's connection with the birds and squirrels to the delightful creatures that help her along the way, these adorable moments add so much warmth to the film. They also help showcase Snow White's kindness and purity. If you love animals in fairy tales, you'll absolutely fall in love with these moments, though at times the cuteness factor might make your heart explode!

Negatives:

The pacing slows down a little in the middle of the film, especially in the quieter moments. While these moments do add emotional depth, they can feel a bit drawn out for some viewers. However, this is a minor issue in an otherwise well-paced film that does a great job of building emotional tension.

Conclusion:

Snow White (2025) is a modern fairy tale that feels fresh, emotional, and deeply relatable. The performances, especially by Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, are top-notch. Gadot's Maleficent is a standout complicated, tragic, and unforgettable. The cuteness of the animal companions adds a light, heartwarming touch, though sometimes it may feel like a little too much. However, it's all part of the charm.

The film's ending, while sad, is perfect for the story it tells: a bittersweet reminder that sometimes, to follow our dreams, we have to let go of things we love. Snow White's journey isn't just about defeating Maleficent-it's about finding her own strength and embracing who she truly is. It's a stunning, emotional experience that leaves you with a sense of fulfillment, but also a little bit of sorrow.",10/10,snow white deeply emotional breathtaking reimagining classic fairy tale leave wiping away tears movie fairy tale rich emotional journey growth loss honestly prepared hard would hit end needed box tissues positives rachel zegler shines snow white brings modern empowering take character making damsel distress snow white strong relatable fully control destiny zegler captures innocence power snow white journey making transformation feel real heartfelt gal gadot portrayal maleficent truly stunning maleficent traditionally villain version adds layers depth character gadot maleficent evil sake woman broken betrayal pain moments ca help sympathize even though actions cruel final confrontation maleficent emotional earned clear deserves defeated still feel weight loss gadot performance brings unique complexity character making defeat satisfying bittersweet one charming parts film cuteness overdose animals snow white connection birds squirrels delightful creatures help along way adorable moments add much warmth film also help showcase snow white kindness purity love animals fairy tales absolutely fall love moments though times cuteness factor might make heart explode negatives pacing slows little middle film especially quieter moments moments add emotional depth feel bit drawn viewers however minor issue otherwise film great job building emotional tension conclusion snow white modern fairy tale feels fresh emotional deeply relatable performances especially rachel zegler gal gadot gadot maleficent standout complicated tragic unforgettable cuteness animal companions adds light heartwarming touch though sometimes may feel like little much however part charm film ending sad perfect story tells bittersweet reminder sometimes follow dreams let go things love snow white journey defeating finding strength embracing truly stunning emotional experience leaves sense fulfillment also little bit sorrow,0.9966,0.336,0.156,0.509

"I viewed Snow White this weekend and found it wonderful. The theatre was full of kids who all seemed to enjoy it.

The music was fantastic - especially ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""Princess Problems"". I didn't miss ""Someday My Prince WIll Come"" - maybe because that is an outdated notion that a princess has to wait for a prince.

Rachel Ziegler was a perfect choice to play Snow White. Her voice was excellent and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Snow White once I saw her performance.

Snow White's character was something to admire. Holding onto her Father's ideals was something to be applauded - not rejected because it wasn't the same as the 1937 version.

There still was an evil queen (Gal Godot - fantastic) who was defeated - not by 1 person but by the community. Again - a great lesson to be learned.

The animation/CGI of forest animals and 7 Dwarfs was in the great Disney tradition and was done well. Grumpy is still my favorite.

"As someone who never cared much for the original Disney Snow white movie this one surprised me. It wasn't bad. It's still not an amazing movie and probably not one I would watch often but I enjoyed it a lot more than the original. With out spoiling as much as I can I'm going to say there are a lot of changes (which is to be expected with the live action versions), and I feel that those changes were made in an attempt to give more life and depth to the characters and overall plot...

"Its a nodern remake, love that disney is keeping up with the diversity in the world. People cling too much to the original and do not see the importance of a little modernization.

The dark forest was a little to much, in my opinion, it gave me a little Alice in wonderland vibes. Didn't have a lot of added value. Would have loved a little more of the storyline about the witch and the ways that she tried to kill Snow White.

But overall, an amazing production. It showed a good storyline and showed al the important thing out of the original fairytail.

"I went into Snow White 2025 with an open mind, and I'm so happy I did. New Snow White isn't trying to be a carbon copy of original. It's a modern retelling that brings new life to the story while still keeping it heart. Zegler delivers a strong heartfelt performance as a Snow White. She brings warmth & charm to the rile, making her feel like a real person rather than just a passive princess. The Visuals are gorgeous, the costumes are stunning.

It's disappointing to see so much unnecessary negativity around this movie. If you actually watch it for what it is. Not for what people on the internet claim. It's a beautifully made movie with a lot of heart.

"Rachel played such an enchanting princess and her voice is truly magical I was in awe watching her on screen. Snow White has meant a lot to me since I was 11 years old and I am so glad an actress this talented and genuine played the character that will always be so close to my heart. Seeing little girls dressed up as her in the theatre made me tear up.

I really enjoyed the version of the love story they did too and their duet was so beautiful it's been on repeat for days.

The dwarves and Evil Queen did not do it for me however. Their scenes felt quite jarring and out of place in the otherwise well adapted fairytale world.

"Disney's new Snow White has been surrounded by controversy from the start, but now that it's finally here, is it really as bad as some claim? Not at all. While the film isn't a groundbreaking masterpiece, it's far from the disaster some have made it out to be.

Rachel Zegler delivers a solid performance as Snow White, with her acting bringing a fresh, independent take on the classic character. Her singing, as expected, is lovely-her voice is one of the highlights of the movie. While her version of Snow White may not appeal to everyone, she carries the role well.

Visually, the film is a mix of stunning set pieces and some questionable CGI moments, which is a common issue in many modern Disney films. The story has been updated, and while some changes might feel unnecessary, they don't ruin the movie. It still carries the heart of the original tale, just with a more modern sensibility.

Disney and the cast certainly made some missteps but the level of hate this movie has received is completely overblown.
